# Admin Portal — ThePeptideAI
_Agents: update this file when you discover gotchas or change admin behavior._

## What the Admin Portal Is
Admin is the **merchant's own back-office** — inventory, orders, finance, partners, automations. Each merchant's admin users only see their own org's data (enforced by RLS + org_id scoping).

Admin ≠ Vendor. Admin = merchant's own staff managing their business. Vendor = PureUSPeptide managing all merchants.

## Commission System — How It Works
This is the most complex and fragile subsystem. Understand it before touching orders or profiles.

```
Order Created/Updated
        ↓
   DB Trigger fires
        ↓
   Reads: order.total, order.contact_id → finds assigned rep (profiles.sales_rep)
        ↓
   Reads: profiles.commission_rate for that rep
        ↓
   Reads: upline chain via profiles.upline_id (multi-level)
        ↓
   Creates commission records for rep + each upline level
        ↓
   Commission status: pending → available (after order is paid) → paid
```

**Rules:**
- Commissions are created by DB trigger — don't create them manually unless debugging
- Changing `order.status` to `paid` automatically marks commissions as `available`
- `profiles.commission_rate` is a percentage (0-100), not decimal
- Downline depth is typically 2-3 levels — the trigger walks up `upline_id` chain
- `pricing_tiers` controls customer-facing discounts; `commission_rate` controls rep payouts — these are separate systems

### Fragile Areas in Commission Flow
- Changing `order_items` after an order is created may cause commission recalculation — test carefully
- Deleting a rep's profile doesn't cascade-delete their commissions — handle manually
- The `DownlineVisualizer` uses a recursive CTE — works fine up to ~100 nodes, may slow past that

## Finance Page — Profitability Calculation
`Finance.tsx` calculates per-order profit using:
```
Net Profit = order.total - COGS - shipping_cost - commission_total
COGS = SUM(bottles.cost_per_unit) for bottles in this order
       (falls back to lot.cost_per_unit if bottle-level cost unavailable)
```

The finance page uses Supabase RPC functions (not direct queries) to handle the aggregation. If you're modifying cost tracking, check the RPC function definitions in migrations.

---

## Automations Engine
`Automations.tsx` + edge function `run-automations`. Rules are stored in `automations` table as JSON. The engine evaluates conditions and fires actions (send email, update record, create task, etc.).

**Don't add new automation action types in the UI without also adding the handler in `run-automations` edge function.** The two must stay in sync.

---

## Feature Flags (org_features)
`FeatureManagement.tsx` lets admins enable/disable features for their org. Some features have UI dependencies:

```
order_management ON → FulfillmentCenter available
fulfillment ON → shipping_labels needed for label printing
client_store ON → ClientStore visible to clients
partner_dashboard ON → partner portal accessible to reps
analytics ON → Finance page shows full data (otherwise limited)
```

If a feature is disabled, its UI should hide gracefully — check `useOrgFeatures()` hook before rendering feature-gated components.
