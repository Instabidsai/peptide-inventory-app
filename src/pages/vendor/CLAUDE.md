# Vendor Portal — ThePeptideAI
_Agents: update this file when you discover gotchas or change vendor behavior._

## What the Vendor Portal Is
The vendor portal is **super-admin** — it's how PureUSPeptide (us) manages ALL merchant tenants on the platform. Only users with `role = 'vendor'` can access it.

A "vendor" can:
- Provision new tenant orgs
- View/edit any tenant's config, users, billing, features
- See analytics across all tenants
- Access audit logs for any org
- Manage wholesale supply orders

**This is the most dangerous part of the codebase.** A bug here can affect ALL tenants simultaneously.

## Critical Rules for This Area

### Never Accidentally Mutate Another Org's Data
When writing any vendor-side code that touches tenant data:
```typescript
// ✅ Always pass the TARGET org's ID explicitly
await updateTenantConfig(targetOrgId, { brand_name: 'New Name' })

// ❌ Never use the current user's orgId for tenant mutations
await updateTenantConfig(currentUser.orgId, { ... }) // This would update YOUR org, not theirs
```

### Provisioning Flow (provision-tenant edge function)
When creating a new tenant, the edge function seeds in this exact order:
1. Insert into `organizations`
2. Insert into `profiles` (admin user)
3. Insert into `tenant_config` (branding row)
4. Seed `org_features` (19 feature flags, all default off except core ones)
5. Seed `pricing_tiers` (Retail/Partner/VIP)
6. Link to `subscription_plans`

**Don't modify this order** — there are FK dependencies.

### Subscription Changes
`TenantSubscriptionActions.tsx` calls Stripe to change plans. Always:
- Update `subscription_plans` link in DB after Stripe confirms
- Never set plan directly in DB without Stripe knowing — they'll be out of sync

### Feature Toggles
`TenantFeatureToggles.tsx` writes to `org_features` table. Rules:
- `client_store`, `order_management`, `fulfillment` are core — think twice before disabling
- Some features have dependent features — disabling `shipping_labels` while `fulfillment` is on causes UI errors in FulfillmentCenter

---

## Auth Guard
The vendor layout (`VendorLayout.tsx`) must check `role === 'vendor'` — not just that the user is logged in. If you're adding a new vendor page, always wrap it in the same auth guard pattern used by existing vendor pages.

---

## SaaS-Safe Mode in Vendor Portal
`TenantFeatureToggles.tsx` supports the `saas_mode` master switch with the same cascade behavior as the admin `FeatureManagement.tsx`:
- Prominent master card at the top with amber highlight when ON
- Toggling `saas_mode` writes all 6 flags (saas_mode + 5 children from `SAAS_MODE_OVERRIDES`) in one DB upsert
- Child flags show amber "SaaS" lock badge and disabled switches when `saas_mode` is ON
- Uses `SAAS_MODE_OVERRIDES` from `feature-registry.ts` for consistent behavior
- Optimistic update handles the multi-flag upsert array
