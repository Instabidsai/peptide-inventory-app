## Claude Code Output

```
TypeScript compiles clean with zero errors, and all 31 test files (342 tests) pass.

The 6 runtime errors were all from the same root cause — a transient HMR reload failure on `OrderDetails.tsx`. The current code on disk is correct:

- **`useSalesOrder`** (singular) is properly imported from `@/hooks/use-sales-orders` (line 2)
- **No duplicate `order` identifier** — it's declared once via `const { data: order, isLoading } = useSalesOrder(id)` (line 81)
- **No syntax errors** — `tsc --noEmit` passes clean

The errors were captured during a live editing session where an intermediate save likely introduced a momentary syntax error or bad reference, causing Vite's HMR to fail and the browser to cache the broken module state. A page refresh would have resolved all 6 errors immediately since the on-disk code has been correct.

**Summary**: No code changes needed. The file is already fixed. `tsc --noEmit` passes, `vitest run` passes (342/342 tests).
