## Claude Code Output

```
All 6 errors are already fixed. Here's the summary:

**Root cause:** All 6 errors stem from the same issue — `OrderDetails.tsx` previously used `useSalesOrders` (the list hook, plural) instead of `useSalesOrder` (the single-order hook, singular). This was already fixed in commit `b36a9c5` ("Fix order detail page: use dedicated single-order hook instead of list filter").

**Verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean, no type errors
- `npx vitest run` — **31 test files passed, 342 tests passed**

The runtime errors were captured from the browser before the fix was applied. The current codebase is clean — no code changes needed.
