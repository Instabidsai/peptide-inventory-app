## Claude Code Output

```
All clean:

- **`tsc --noEmit`**: No type errors
- **`vitest run`**: 342 tests passed, 31 test files, 0 failures

The 6 reported errors were all the same root issue — `OrderDetails.tsx` previously referenced `useSalesOrders` (plural) instead of `useSalesOrder` (singular), and had a duplicate `order` variable declaration. The recent commit `b36a9c5` ("Fix order detail page: use dedicated single-order hook instead of list filter") already fixed this by switching to the correct `useSalesOrder` hook. The runtime errors were captured before that fix was applied and the browser's HMR cache was stale.

No code changes needed — the issues are already resolved in the current working tree.
