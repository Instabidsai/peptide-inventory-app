Yeah, January third. Got a January coffee mug in my hands now. So, today is an interesting it's an interesting topic. Lupus. So, I love how all of you Thank you, by the way, put your faith in my ability to find a solution for what's going on. Thank you for that. So, the bottom line is this. Today, you guys trust me with your health and finding solutions for a lot of the things that are going on that you're just not getting answers to. And I understand that. I understand how frustrating that is. And I understand how broken and corrupt the system is. And how managed decline is not healthcare. And that is what big pharma does. And medical doctors are largely useless. They are coming from a trade school for pharmaceutical reps and nothing more. And I don't care if you're a doctor, you get it offended. I've been a doctor for a long time. I don't care. Your job above all do no harm. It is imperative that we take care of people because they trust us. The world has become a place where it's okay to not take care of people and go, "So, I tried. I did my best, but you didn't. You did your laziest. So, I'm going to clear up lupus. I'm going to give you all the answers. I'm going to help you get on your way. And if that's if that gives you the solution, if that helps you get past something, just share it. That's all. Just share it because people need to know this. And I don't do any marketing even for Elite Biogenics or we're or the black card. I don't do any marketing. I do this. I talk about it. You want to buy everything from Elite Biogenics? Awesome. You go right ahead. I will make sure that my company takes incredible care of you. And if you don't, that's okay. I still show up. And if you want to join the black card and get access to my live Q&A call that I do every Monday evening and the VIP community and the great community that I've built of incredible men and women who I'm so grateful trust me with their life and their health and have become for lack of a better word family to me then you know what you send yes there's a fee you send an email to applyunlockthecard.com com and I it's wire transfer only. I told you the deadline was extended. So tick tock people, tick tock because if you want to get in, you better hustle because it's not going to stay extended. I just had dozens and dozens and dozens of emails going, "Please, I'm trying to get in." So I'm trying to help you, but this isn't for me. This is for you. So if you want in, don't dick around. You want to join, then actually do it. Send the wire and get in the program. You still get it for last year's price. If not, extension's over, baby. But you better email if you want and say, "Hey, please let me in." And then Amber or Jen will get you all set up with a wire and away you go. And that's a year per person. But if you don't, that's okay, too. I keep showing up here and give you the best I got. You guys have been told about lupus. And lupus is they what do they call it, right? The disease of a 100 different faces and all the nonsense. But that's not accurate. They told you it's this complex, incurable, mysterious autoimmune disease. and that the best hope that you've got is managed decline just to slow the progress, right? And yet the problem is that's not accurate at all. That's not a diagnosis, you guys. That's a death sentence. And it's based on a century of scientific cowardice and pharmaceutical greed. Listen, I don't I'm going to give you I'll give you boy, I hate to use this word, but it's like cur e not theory. Real protocol built on biology that is always ignored and will continue to be ignored because it's not profitable. But I don't make any money off of this. Even if you bought from Elite Biogenics, I'm not going to be a trillionaire anytime soon from people buying from my peptide company and it's giant. It doesn't matter because I'm doing it because I want people to have the answer and the solution, not because I'm trying to make you more sick so you keep buying my stuff. I do it so you're well and you don't ever need me. That's the difference with where I where my mind comes from, where my heart and soul comes from. So, you need to rip the band-aid off this festering wound that looks a lot like modern rheumatology. Look at the basics that they just don't want to state plainly that are pure fact. Lupus is lupus is friendly fire. Okay, lupus is friendly fire. Your immune system is an army. In lupus, that army has been fed some really lousy intelligence for so long that it's turned its own weapons on its own people. So you've got these cells like the little snipers, whatever you want to call them, your T- cells and B cells, and they've gone nuts. They've gone mad. The proof is in the blood. Anti-uclear antibodies are called annas. You do an ana test. This is a whole other conversation about lab work. But these antibodies aren't the disease. They're the brass that's left, the bullet casings that's left at the scene of the crime. The crime is a failure of central command, the thymus. Okay. 2002 journal of experimental medicine showed clearly by the way the thymus and lupus patients fails to properly eliminate self-reactive tea cells but during their development right so these robe cells escape into the bloodstream it's a ticking time bomb just ready to annihilate you because when a cell dies a natural death apoptosis right the contents especially DNA they're supposed to be cleaned up very neatly they're just mopped up and swept up very neatly in lupus This cleanup is a disaster. The DNA and all the other nuclear debris spills out. The rogue B cells now hyperactive because of the collapse in regulatory T- cell function see this debris as a foreign army as an invader and they go full war. They declare war on you. So they produce antibodies that attack the debris and then attack any healthy cell. Here's the problem. They attack any healthy cell that looks even remotely close or just even if it's similar. They go after it. This creates immune complexes, clumps of antibodies and self antigen, right? Antibodies antigen that get stuck in the tiny blood vessels of your kidneys, your skin, your brain. This clogging triggers the compliment system. It's this cascade of proteins that essentially calls in an air strike on the location and the result vasculitis, tissue destruction, organ failure. It's not a mystery. It's a chain of command failure with a very clear biochemical trail. And yet, how many times have you guys if you have if you're listening to this and you have lupus or you've been d most the time it's a misdiagnosis anyway. You don't even have lupus. But people go, you fit these little you check these boxes. But just think about this. Act and HIV, the quote unquote cure and the disease have the same symptomatology. That should set off giant red flags in your head. By the way, immunosuppression is one of them. Just so you know, your immune system should never be suppressed ever. It's keeping you alive. So, back up to L. You guys don't screw with your biology, man. I don't come out here to make you buy my products. I come out here or to join my black card membership. I come out here to give you an answer so you actually run radar, right? Just d paying attention to everything so you know what's real and what's not. You know what the early sign of lupus is? Rosacea. Who told you that? Nobody. You think it's a cosmetic issue? Dermatology told you it's about spicy food and red wine and maybe some dark chocolate. That's the nonsense. They feed they just feed you this and you go, "Oh, okay. It's a dermatologist. They said that's what it is." What a croc of crap. That is incompetence. 16 study in drama dermatology showed significantly higher risk of autoimmune disease including in fact specifically lupus SLE systemic lupus arithmatosis in patients with rosacea. The link LL37. Yep, that one. Which is why you don't bomb somebody all that you have to be really if you guys go well but what about taking LL37 hypothetically when you have lupus. Yes to regulate it but under somebody telling you what to do in the dosage not some Reddit form or Kora or Bro Science guy in a tank top and bulging out everywhere with a trap vein thinking that he knows what he's talking about because he can read chat GPT. That's not helping understand biology. If you come to me with it and you're like hey should I take it or should I not? I can't give you an answer unless I until I see your labs, talk to you, and actually go down the rabbit hole on your symptomatology, which is exactly what I do in the black art, by the way. So, the point is I want you to be healthy, but you can't just throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. So, LL37, that's the problem, right? Caffealin in ro in rosacea, the innate immune system in the skin is disregulated. It's overproducing this antimicrobial peptide which triggers a very localized inflammatory fire. Rosacea is it's the canary for lupus, right? canary in the wine shaft just freaks out because there's gases there. It's a canary in the coal mine. If the body's screaming that the inflammatory breaks are failing, you need to listen, which is what this rosacea is. If you have rosacea, your immune system is already cranked up on high alert and lupus is when it jumps the fence, takes you out, and now you have nowhere to go. You can handle rosacea. You can look at to see if you have a parasitic issue. You can check your spleen. You can see like when you your spleen is usually got some kind of an infection, parasitic, bacterial, whatever, viral. There's a whole bunch of things that it can be, but a stool sample will tell you exactly what the problem is. If you look at what the problem is, you start solving the problem. You never have to worry about lupus. But they just go, I don't know what just showed up. That's not how disease works. Disease shows up because of the three biological failures 100% of the time. I'm right. I will take it to my grave that I'm right, and I still think I should get a Nobel Prize for it. Lupus is the ultimate expression of the three biological failures that underly every single chronic disease on earth. Just connect the dots that they refuse to connect. Look at system look at systemic inflammation. It's the trigger. It's the trigger. It's not just swelling. This is a biochemical war zone you guys. In lupus, the initial auto antibbody production ignites this cytoine conflration. TNF alpha is right. All of these IFN all of them. These aren't just inflammatory markers that you see on a lab. They're molecular signals that bombard every single cell in your body. 9 immunological reviews showed how IFN specifically creates hyperactive immune environment that impairs regulatory tea cell function promotes the survival of those rogue autoreactive B cells that you're trying to get rid of. This inflammation because of the thymus, right? This inflammation is the constant scream that tells your body it's under attack. That's just the inflammatory problem. Look at the insulin resistance. Okay, this is the like putting gas. It's like smashing the skinny pedal. Here's the link that medicine ignores. Those inflammatory cytoines 100%. Listen to the words coming out of my mouth. Listen to me. What? Proven. The research is endless. There's about 17,000 studies that show this. 100% directly cause insulin resistance. And people go inflammatory issues aren't the problem. They are the problem. And if you go, wouldn't that be the primary problem? No, it's just the catalyst that sets off this terrific holocaust in your system. TNF alpha and IL6 activate the series of kynases GNK etc. that phosphorolate IRS insulin receptor substrate 1 on serereine residues. Now just follow me cuz I explained this serene phosphorilation is what causes the problem. This blocks the normal tyroine phosphorilation needed for the insulin signal to travel down the pathway. It's like right for glute 4 transporters. It's like pouring glue into the lock of your front door. The key, sticking gum in it, whatever you want to say, filling with crazy glue, I don't care what example you use, putting duct tape over it, whatever. The insulin, the key, right, can't turn. So glucose can't get into the cell and the result is hypoglycemia. But worse, now the cell is starving for fuel while floating around in this sugar-rich bloodstream. So this creates a advanced glycation end products that damage tissues and blood vessels. Remember rage receptors creating, you guessed it, more inflammation. 2015 paper in Nature Reviews Rheumatology 100% linked insulin resistance to increased disease activity in lupus patients precisely. Specifically, specifically, it's a vicious cycle that they treat with steroids that cause more insulin resistance. It's madness to me. I honestly can't get my head around it other than it's for profit because they're not looking to solve your problems. They're looking to keep you managed and profitable. Look at ATP shortage. This is the ultimate collapse of your entire system. This is the final failure of your whole biology. With insulin resistance blocking glucose entry, the mitochondria obviously are starved of their primary fuel. Right? So the TCA, the KB cycle starts to sputter and die. The ETC, electron transport chain becomes very inefficient and it leaks out electrons that generate this flood of ROS's reactive oxygen species. Right? This is the oxidative stress. This mitochondrial dysfunction is catastrophic. 2018 cell metabolism proved te- cells from lupus patients have profoundly dysfunctional mitochondria which alters their metabolism promotes their auto-inflammatory phenotype causes this chaos. The cells responsible for policing right looking around self other policing the immune response are running on E. So they can't do anything because they don't have the gas. This energy crisis isn't a side effect, you guys. It's the engine of the disease. The fatigue is I drives me nuts. Somebody told me this and my doctor told me it was psychological. Are you high? You feel free to ball up your fist and punch that doctor right in the face. Are you out of your mind? The fatigue isn't psychological. It's a systemic ATP bankruptcy problem. You don't have the very currency for life, a denazine triphosphate to fund all of your transactions for life. You guys see this loop, right? Inflammation causes insulin resistance. Insulin resistance causes mitochondrial dysfunction, right? The ATP shortage. Mitochondrial dysfunction generates reactive oxygen species, right? Oxidative stress that fuels more inflammation. So, when a patient arrives with this systemic civil war, what's the standard of care? It's this medical list of atrocities. Look at the gold standard that these cowards and you guys need to step up. It's it's like the IRS. You guys need to step up and go, you know what? You guys can pound sand. 1913, nobody was paying tax. You think your taxes are going to anything in your country? You better take a long hard look at where your money's going. Imagine if you spent, this is totally off subject. Imagine if you spent all your money in your own town supporting all the businesses in your own town. You didn't jump on Amazon every day and give Jeffy B more money. You didn't opt for I need to be more green and take longer to get my delivery. You need to go and spend money in your neighborhood and support all the businesses there and go back to that kind of world. I promise you all the money you put in your own town will benefit the town. Let me know how federal taxes benefit your town. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. They don't. So save it. Look at this gold standard train wreck dumpster fire that they give you for lupus. Hydroxychloricquin plaquin, right? This is the safe drug. It works. It works by very weakly inhibiting TLRs toll-like receptors and raising the pH in something called a lizoome which slightly reduces the processing of auto antigens. But here's the catastrophic side effect of this entire thing. Reversible retinal toxicity. The drug accumulates in the retinal pigment epithelium and causes permanent blindness. Laundry list of people that have had this go through. So you're trading one disability for another. Does this sound common? because they do this all the time. You guys can see this with just about anything. Find the drug. Listen to any drug commercial. Hey, Renvoke, it does this very rarely, but it does all of this awesome stuff that makes you a disaster physiologically and biologically for life. But you guys sign up and go, I took it. It was great for me. No, it wasn't. And you know it wasn't. You're just You don't want to be wrong. Listen, please pay attention cuz I come out here because I care. I come out here cuz you have no idea. It brings me to tears sometimes. I've laid in my bed and teared up because I care so damn much about mankind because I'm so thoroughly disgusted at 52 going on 53 at how you guys are being abused. How we're all being abused having drugs shoved into us, sprayed on us, poured on our water, put on our food, put on our skin, given to our children, given to our elderly instead of going, "We are designed to be a juggernaut and they have convinced you otherwise." You are so freaking strong and all you do is go, I guess I'm just it's my genetics. It's not your genetics. It's their psychology that they're pointing they're poisoning you with. Please listen to me. Think about the permanent damage it's causing to your eyes. The retinal pigment epithelium 2016 American Academy of Opthalmology guideline mandates regular eye exams because the damage is silent, credibly severe, irreversible, and progressive. Happens real quick. Predinazone. There's the next one. I talked about this a minute ago. This is like a wrecking ball. It's my favorite term, right? Think I'm listening to Katy Perry too much, maybe. Shut up. It's my show. Anyway, so a synthetic gluccocorticoid, right? Indiscriminately suppresses inflammation by inhibiting the transcription factor NFCappa B. Now, we know about NFCappa B if you followed me for any amount of time. But here's the problem. When you suppress indiscriminately, suppress all your inflammation, it's like using a fire extinguisher that also melts the foundation of the entire building. So Stark Tower, you put out the fire but it sinks into the ground and falls over. The side effects are this textbook of disease. Cushing syndrome, moonface, the buffalo hump, right? Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, which you already know if you've listened to me. Type two diabetes is the precursor to type three diabetes, which is Alzheimer's and dementia, neuronal starvation, proteolyis, muscle wasting. The most brutal of all, by the way, that most people don't tell you, but if you look up any lupus research, you'll see this, especially with people on predinazone. Go outside of lupus. Just look at people on predinazone, long-standing prennazone. Avascular necrosis. This is where the blood supply to your bones typically, by the way, the femoral head, right? The hip, right? There's the acetabulum on the head of the femur. It's cut off. So, the bone dies, becomes necrotic, it dies, it collapses, right? The tbecular bone gives out the cortex crumbles and you need a hip replacement when you're 31,000 I think it was 2000 2000 study lupus the journal 20% of lupus patients on steroids developed osteonnecrosis people call that number significant I call that appalling this isn't treatment you guys that's not treatment it's a government sanctioned publicly supported utilation you guys are mad about the wrong things cuz you you get addicted to social media you guys need to look at how mankind is being treated. How for all the years that they've been doing cancer research, for example, and how many trillions have gone into cancer research, cancer's increased by almost 75%. They're not looking for a cure. They're convincing you that they are. So, you stay on the hook. Look at my micate mat, right? Cell. This is a This is like a chemical weapon. It's an anti- metabolite. It works by inhibiting enzyme monophosphate dehydrogenase imph. It's this crucial enzyme in the what's called the denovo pathway of purine synthesis. Since lymphosytes are pretty much the only cells I as far as I've ever seen that rely as heavily as they do on this pathway. The drug selectively nukes your adaptive immune system. What did I just say about your immune system? Why would you ever want to nuke it? It's not going to make you healthier. It's going to make put you into a bubble and make you have to hide from the world. And even then you're still going to get sick and die. The catastrophic side effect by the way profound bone marrow suppression. What do you think? So what what gets created in the flat bones? The marrow of the flatbones. Give you a hint. Red blood cells. There you go. Is a rhetorical questions. Lucopenia neemia thrombocytoenia making you a walking target for fatal infections. It's a incredibly brutal. FDA just so you know this is how bad it is. FDA pregnancy category D. D causes cranioacial and cardiovascular malf forations. Why are you taking the chance with that with your baby that you're developing? You're their best chance. You might get mad at what I'm about to say. I don't care. Don't be a selfish prick. Suffer while you're building that baby because you are their best chance. I adore my children. Oh god, I love Pierce and Hope so much. My wife took one for the team with both kids. Never took a drop of any medication. No alcohol, no nothing. Ate trained. She was all baby until about 8 months. Like just she didn't you could barely see her until about 8 months rather. Like maybe seven and a half. And when you did see her, she was all baby. She was fit. Tiny little butt. Little bun in the oven. That's it. And our kids are badass. They're fit. They're strong. They're healthy because we made them that way cuz we took no chances. And when I say we, I mean her. She's Listen, you guys walking around going, I had to struggle, too. I didn't have sex for 9 months or I had sex all the time or whatever it is. If your wife turned into a nyo when she was pregnant, I've seen it go both ways. So, whatever. The conversations that you guys share with me are mindblowing sometimes. But the point is, who cares? You're building a person. Support your wife. Love your wife. Help her with every whatever she needs. I used to go get the same taco on my way home from seeing patients every day for 7 months. Every day, same taco place. They It was so often it was ever it was 5 days a week. They would ask, "Hey, how's your wife doing? How's the baby? How's the baby coming? How?" And next thing you know, I didn't show up. And I went back there one day when after our um son was born and they went, "Oh my god." It because it was our son, our daughter we had already had. and they asked nothing but pictures and they sent a whole bunch of new tacos to to Brandy. Take care of your spouse. I realize this has nothing to do with this podcast, but it doesn't matter. Take care of your spouse when you're doing this, but at the same time, you damn well better take care of that baby. I don't care how sick you are. My wife, she was sick for 4 months. I did everything I could to alleviate that. She wouldn't take medication if you held a gun to her head. Why? Because she said, "I'm the baby's best chance." I have so much respect for my wife. She is a juggernaut. That's your job as a mom. You've been convinced that you're like, "It's okay to just take some medication." No, it's not. And if you want to get in my comments and get mad about that, you know what? You can go right to hell and don't bother following me because we're not going to get along. I think it's juvenile to take a chance with your child. I do. So, when I talk about this people taking rightylolate cell sept, if you need to know what it's called, it causes and you're okay with taking a chance with your baby. There's a reason how they know that, by the way, because it's happened. Here's the best part of this of cell. Long-term. Long-term being longer than 8 months. By the way, that's what long-term is in this in this case. According to research proven increases the risk of lymphoma by 50%. 2005 New England Journal of Medicine confirmed its efficacy. Really, it did. I'm not going to crap on this completely for lupus nefritis specifically, but the price is turning the patient to a into a chronically immunompromised walking cancer target. Make it make sense. Make it make sense. You can't. You guys, this is managed decline. It's a business model, not a cure. It's makes zero sense because it ignores the root cause of the entire problem which fits perfectly into a very simple, irrefutable model of all chronic disease. My three biological failures. Where's my Nobel Prize? I'll say it again. I will go over this with perfect clarity. Systemic inflammation. Again, the autoimmune attack creates the cytoine hurricane. TNF alpha, IL6, IFN, all of this stuff. There's your inflammation induces insulin resistance, right? Inflammation causes 100% of the time. These cytoines phosphorolate IRS1 insulin receptor substrate one on serereine residues instead of tyrosine. So it blocks the pathway. So your cells become death to insulin. Don't hear it at all. Don't see it, don't hear. So glucose floods the bloodstream glycating proteins and creating AES, advanced glycation end products, excuse me, that cause significantly more damage. There's your insulin resistance. And then this triggers the ATP shortage because glucose can't get into the cells to feed the mitochondria, the power plants, right? The little power plants that keep you alive. The KB cycle, the TCA cycle, whatever you want to call it, right? Just pukes. It starts belching purple smoke on the freeway. It doesn't work. The ETC, electron transport, electron transport chain, effectively tanks. ATP production tanks. This mitochondrial dysfunction generates a flood of ROS's reactive oxygen species, which is the oxidative stress, which feeds right back into, ready for this mic drop moment? More systemic inflammation. Lupus isn't just autoimmune. It's a metabolic and energetic catastrophe. And the drugs, they take a jerry can of gas and pour it all on the already lit crazy fire. It turns it into a epic flamethrower. Predinazone is a direct cause of insulin resistance. Micopenolate attacks the rapidly dividing cells in a body already struggling to produce energy. This, you guys have to understand this. They're giving you things that aren't solving the problem. They're just telling you it does. But look at the laundry list of effects that it has on the other side of the equation. You're missing the point. And I get it. You're desperate for relief, but if the relief costs you your life, it's not relief. You're just you're volunteering to put yourself out of your own misery. That doesn't make sense to me. Solve the freaking problem. Which is why I'm here every day. Never mind that. Look at the deficiencies, the nutrient deficiencies in lutr lupus p patients. It's not random. This is even easier. No, this will not solve the entire problem, but it sure as hell helps. Vitamin D deficiency. It's caused by sun avoidance and steroid use. It's crucial for T- regulatory function. By the way, you need it. Deficiency worsens the immune dysregulation, so it pours more gas on the fire. Look at B12. Caused by malabsorption from gut inflammation and drugs like methtoresate, which is a chemotherapeutic drug. They also give you that four rheumatoid arthritis for your flare-ups, except it's chemotherapy. Get it through your head. Chemotherapy is never good for you ever. Full stop. Leads to megaloplastic anemia, worsened neuropathic brain fog, so you become stupid and deficient by decision just by missing a vitamin. And no, not all vitamins are the same. And if some instab biohacker brea zeot is pushing nothing but vitamins, that's not going to help you. The system is still offline. I get so many people from Brea going, "All he did was give me vitamins from his vitamin store." Go figure. Listen, you want to buy your whatever you're buying. I'm always hesitant to say it, the peptides, all the stuff from someone else. You go right ahead. I'm not hawking my stuff. You want to buy from Elite? Awesome. I don't care. I still come out here and give you the answer. I personally, Thorn, Orthomolelecular, Professional Complimentary Health Formulas, period. Those are the companies I use. I use nobody else. That's it. I don't use any other company for vitamins ever because I trust them. Iron deficiency, that's another one. Anemia of chronic disease, right? Hepsidant, it's an inflammatory cytoine that traps iron inside the macroofagages. It prevents it from being used for red blood cell production. RBCs are important, right? They carry oxygen. Vitamin B6 deficiency, increased metabolic de demand from the chronic inflammation that you're walking around in all the time. Deficiency, by the way, exacerbates the neuropathy that you have when you have lupus. Listen you guys, the system writes off patients with lupus because it's built on a flawed premise. It's built on suppression instead of restoration of your biology. The solution isn't to kill the immune system. That doesn't even make sense to me cuz it makes you a walking liability to yourself. It's to re reboot it started again, get it working. You need to restore order to your system. Eliminate the three biological failures and the problem solved. You need to fix them. And if somebody goes, "Oh, here you go hawking your stuff again." I'm right. You know the guy that invented being out of gas? This is being sarcastic, by the way. He's not wrong. When your car sputters to a halt because the tank is empty, put gas in the tank and your car runs again. It might be something else. It sure might be, but if your tank is empty, that's the first place I'm looking. You need an entire protocol that solves this problem with surgical precision. So, let me explain a few things that work very well. Thus, Alpha 1, SS31. I couldn't think of a better dynamic duo. Thymosin alpha 1 master regulator produced by the thymus the very organ that fails in lupus. Huh strange. 2014 annals of the New York Academy of Sciences proved its actions. It boosts CD4 and CD8 T cell function. Enhances T- regulatory cell activity which are the peacekeepers right. Promotes dendritic cell maturation. So you get better intelligence for your immune system. Not brain for your byproduct because of inflammatory and insulin resistance but for your immune system. it becomes better at surveillance and it modulates cytoine production towards a tolerogenic state. It's literally replacement therapy for the failing thymic function. That's I'll even go through every process just so you understand so I don't just explain what these things do. This 31 mitochondrial targeted antioxidant, right? We already know inner mitochondrial membrane has this very unique sequence that allows it to concentrate a thousandfold. It's like it's got a magnet to the inner mitochondrial membrane. scavenges ROS's reactions of reactive oxygen species at the source of production complexes one and four of the ETC electron transport chain 2017 study JCI insight proved it protects ptoytes in kidney disease which the reason I bring this up is because it's a direct application for lupus nephritis these things are really important because you have to look at what they're doing and how they're affecting the system just watch them work system by system these look at the integimementaryary system right the skin so the butterfly rash the discoid lesions the immune immune complexes deposited in the dermis activating compliment all that stuff. Thymosin alpha calms the aberarent teac cell response that's attacking the skin. SS31 protects caratinosytes and fibroblasts from mitochondrial oxidative stress promoting the tissue repair and reducing all the lesion formation. That's just the beginning. Look at the cardiovascular system. Lupus causes this very accelerated atherosclerosis and paricarditis. Paricarditis, you don't want to screw around with that, by the way. Chronic inflammation damages the endothelium. Thymosin alpha 1 shuts down the cytoine storm that drives all this damage. And SS-31 proven by the way 2013 study in circulation protects all of the endothelial cells and cardiammyioytes from mitochondrial rather permeability transitioning pore open transition pore opening. So here's what that means. It prevents cell death and preserves heart function. And if you go why didn't you just say that? Because I want you to understand the mechanism. Look at the kidneys. This is where the by the way lupus beats the crap out of your kidneys. Okay, renal system. Lupus nephritis. I just talked about this. Immune complexes clog the glomemerieli the little filtering units. So it inflames these little tufts of vessels, these little filtration units. Thymus and alpha 1 reduces the production of the pathogenic antibodies. The SS-31 directly protects the energyintensive mitochondria of the renal tubular cells and the protocytes which I was just talking about preventing their apoptosis the cell death and preserving the kidney's filtration capacity so you don't run into like kidney disease or failure which is all possible with lupus you guys look at the hematic system anemia lucopenia thrombocytoenia thyosin alpha 1 is rebalances the hematopoesis in the bone marrow by modulating the inflammatory signals that disrupt it in the first place. So you have to think of this from the thousand foot view, not the mitigating symptomatology view because that doesn't help anything. Which is where pharmaceutical companies want you to stare at the symptoms because it's an easy cell. Pain here, solve here, but what if the pain isn't here? What if this is just the result? Pain here, solve here, your fingers on the element, and they go, let's give you something to numb the pain, but your finger's still on the element. How about you just take the hand off the element? You got to think differently about your biology. So look at SS31. It protects the hemop hematopoetic cells, the stem cells specifically from the oxidative stress that impairs their ability to differentiate into healthy strong word there, healthy blood cells. Look at the muscularkeeletal system. All of these are massive. This is these are primary areas of what lupus destroys and attacks and causes the most problems. And we can get into the neurological system. We can there's so many things we could go into, but this would be a podcast of 4 hours long. So muscularkeeletal system we've got arthritis, myalgia, thyus and alpha 1 reduces the inflammatory cytoines IL1, IL6, TNF alpha, all of them that attack the sinovium right of the joints. SS31 improves ATP production in skeletal muscle mitochondria. So this directly combats the crippling fatigue that is not psychological. Don't you dare let some doctor tell you that. I told you. Ball up your fist, punch him right in the head. The crippling fatigue and it promotes muscular repair. SS31 M C is another variation that you want to add to this. You got to take them in the right hierarchy. M C first, SS31 second, M C third for your kangaroo. But that's a whole other conversation that I can't legally talk about here. You have to address the broken off switch. By the way, in this entire thing, the colonergic anti-inflammatory pathway, and this is where people get really twitchy. So, this is your vagus nerves direct line. Vegas nerve direct line to your immune system. So when it's activated, it releases acetylcholine which binds to the hold it up alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on macrophagages. That's why this thing is so savage. This binding specifically inhibits NFCappa B transllocation, instantly shutting down the TNF alpha production. It's the body's built-in circuit breaker for inflammation. In lupus, this pathway is completely dysfunctional, broken. So, this is why I'm talking about this. These, it's not about vaping or smoking. It's not the same or pouches or any of that's far too heavy of a hit. Instant hyperloaded, hypervolictive. This is not This is about pharmarmacology. This I have to say this cuz I can't say it cuz they'll pinch this video. This alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist that I'm holding in my hand that looks a lot like a flat thing that you stick on your body. 2011, the journal of immunology. It proved that alpha 7 nicotenic acetylcholine receptor agonism, the little patch that sticks to your body, reduced massively anti-dsna antibodies, protein ura and kidney damage solely from activating this pathway, but it's bad for you, right? Listen, they're not I'm not talking about intoxicating a patient or doing something stupid. I'm talking about restoring a critical biological signal that's been silenced in SLE. Listen, you want to know you want to go down the rabbit hole? Let's do this. Okay, let's do Let me drink some coffee. I'll just give you the whole freaking thing cuz I'm tired of people going, "What do I do? How do I do it? What do I do?" Listen, you want this entire thing? I'm going to make this post on Instagram today in a very short stubby little version with a full Listen, if you guys can't figure out how to go click the button if you the button never shows up, move to my country. You guys in in other countries are freaking out cuz the button doesn't show up. That's not my problem. That's not my problem. If you can't figure out how to go into your DMs, I had some guy ask me, "Where do I get this?" Ashley said, "Have you opened any of the frigin research I've given you?" "No, sir, I haven't." I go, "How about you start there? Trying to help you guys." So, let's go line by line through this. Thymus alpha 1, alpha 1 reboots the central immune tolerance, fixes the intelligence failure, the immune intelligence failure, right? SS31 protects mitochondrial integrity, ends that ATP crisis, and reduces the massive ROS, the reactive oxygen species leak, right? The oxidative stress. M C mitochondrial derived peptide transllocates to the nucleus. I say it every time to regulate metabolic stress response genes. That's how this works. Period. It improves glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and it directly attacks failure too. We already know that lupus is a product of the three systemic failures 100%. I just proved it. BPC-157, you can call this like Kevin Coer, right? It's a bodyguard peptide. promotes angioenesis, healing of the GI tract, repairs the leaky gut that fuels the antigenic load that's entering the lipopolyaccharides that are puking out of your sewer system. What do I say? Into the nice self-contained closed loop system of your circulatory system where it's not supposed to be. Then the immune system freaks out and sees it causes all kinds of problems. GKCU master regulator of gene expression 4,000 plus genes shifts the thousands and thousands of genes from a profile of inflammation to one of repair and tissue remodeling. And then the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism patch. It's stupid. This is a free country. I shouldn't have to do this. It's ridiculous. Pisses me off to be honest. January 3rd, 2026. And I'm like, I better be careful what I say. Activates this anti-inflammatory pathway. It's like an instant off switch for cytoine production. It's that fast. I can't explain how how savage it works if you're afraid to try it because you used to be a smoker or something. They're not even in the same league. They don't do the same thing. It's not how it works. 15 pyroines, 599 extra chemicals added to it. Like I I could do this. I just don't have honestly the desire right now to get into proving it. You decide. You want to go and take all predinazone and everything else. You knock yourself out. Hydroxychloricquin. I It's fine. But I'm sitting here giving you a solution cuz I genuinely give a damn about you and I don't even know you. But I genuinely care. This protocol attacks the three failures all at the same time. Thyson alpha 1 and the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism extinguishes the fire of systemic inflammation. Moni SS31 restores the insulin sensitivity and eliminates the ATP shortage. BPC-15 GHkcu repairs all the collateral damage that's been going on. You're not managing decline. You're rebuilding the biological infrastructure from the ground up. The current paradigm of healthcare in general, you guys, is a surrender. It's a billion trillion dollar industry that profits from patient suffering. I say this all the time. It's a failure of intellect, failure of courage, failure of basic scientific integrity. It disgusts me. The tools for a cure exist because it it comes back to building yourself into a juggernaut where pathology can't survive. The research is published everywhere. It's ignored because healthy patients are not a sustainable revenue stream, right? So, they're going to keep throwing everything at you. ads, doctors calling you, making you feel guilty for not taking what they prescribe. You need to stop managing symptoms. You guys, you want all the information on this, you're going to have to go to Instagram and tap in the keyword because I legally can't say it, which is ridiculous cuz I could tell all you about how to take all about it. I could tell you every last detail about it, which makes no sense because it will not solve your problem. You need to engineer remissions in your physiology where there's a biological problem. The mystery of lupus was solved decades ago. The problem, you guys, listen to me. It very It frustrates me because in 2026, I'm actually giving you the answer. The only remaining mystery to all of this is why anybody is choosing to ignore the answer. Anyway, listen. I hope you got something out of this. I don't come out here for me. I come out here for you. Cuz if you haven't figured it out yet, I love the crap out of you. And you should. I'm the only doctor out here doing this because I don't have an ulterior motive or a secret agenda. I'm just a bald bearded dog who genuinely gives a [ __ ] I hope you got something out of this. I gotta go.
