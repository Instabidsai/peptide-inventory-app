So, DIP, this is a, for lack of a better explanation, a master class on DIP. It's funny because I was about to do this entire episode with my generator keeping this little studio alive so I could do it, which I've done before. Texas is wild, man. The grid here is a train wreck. The build quality of houses here is a disaster. I'll give you everything I got on DIP. And listen, I come out here because I want you to be healthy. I don't give a crap if you buy from me. I don't care if you join the black card or not. None of that matters to me. I come out here because our job as health care professionals. Like, my job as a doctor is to help you. It's not to get online and make reaction videos to something somebody said in their podcast cuz it it hurt my feelings or it goes against what I say. It's I'm supposed to come out here and give you all the information so you know what you're doing so you can actually have a great life, which is the only reason I come out here. So, it's always weird to me when people get in my comments and start bitching and whining or you guys strip clips from me and you make reaction videos to it. And then I realized follow the money. And I look because you guys are all selling garbage and bunk and you're defending your blends and your nasal sprays and your orals and none of it's true, you know, and these wannabe medical students getting in my comments bitching and whining instead of going, you know what, Mike, you're a glorified pharmaceutical rep. There is nobody coming out of medical school right now. None. None. That is an actual doctor. None. You guys are you're coming out of a trade school to be a pharmaceutical rep. Don't get mad. be better because my job is to help as many people as possible, not drug as many people as possible. I would prefer you're not on anything. So the point is I come out here so you have the information. What you do with it is up to you. That's my rant. But DEIP master class and listen this is they've been you guys have been told so many wonderful articulated lies about peptides, about medication, about healthcare. And I'm going to unwind all of this. And here's what's wild about DIP. It just kills me. This isn't even a new lie. It's a 50-year-old lie that they're tell it's just for sleep. No, it's not. That's the last thing that is that's a side effect of DIP. That's like saying reatride is for weight loss. No, it's not. Reatrutide is arguably the most effective peptide I've that's ever been introduced outside of BPC-157. It is probably the most effective peptide that's ever been introduced to the world, ever, which is why they're fighting so hard to hide it from you or charge you astronomically large amounts of money. Like this was this Soviet discovery, right? Dip that got labeled as a sleep peptide and then got buried in Western medicine because they didn't want you to have it. Because when you understand what DIP really does, listen, you understand that the entire medical industry, all medical doctors, the entire pharmaceutical industry is built on managing disease rather than preventing it. And you guys are falling for it. How about you just go, this is my body and I'm damn well going to take care of it. I'm not handing it over to me to anybody. Which is the, you know, that that's why I created the black card. You guys even know that I made the black card because I wanted people to have a place to go where they can get real answers. You bet your ass it has a fee. You bet your ass it's going to cost you a ton of money. But I also solve all of your problems. So if you're going to spend 25 grand to join by wire transfer only, by the way, you get direct access to me. I've proven myself time and time again. I don't need to keep doing it. I'm exceptional at what I do because I care that much about you that I will bleed. I'll stay awake at night trying to figure out your problem and I'll do it, which I have done. I've stayed awake 1:30, 2:00, 2:30 in the morning looking over labs and listening to people's symptoms and putting things together and actually figuring out the biology so I know what's going on. And then I've solved their [ __ ] problem because that's my job. I you could come into my group. There's hundreds of people that don't have problems anymore because they actually had somebody listen and pay attention and solve it, not go here, take this drug because this is the drug I'm supposed to tell you to take for your symptoms. So, if you want to join you, Mia is my personal executive assistant. She is the bomb and she is going to take care of you. Apply at unlockthecard.com and she'll get you all set up. And if you want to buy from Elite Biogenics, my company, great. If you don't, okay, again, I'll still be here helping you. That's what it looks like when you give a [ __ ] about people, not stomping your feet, pouting, making reaction videos, and getting in people's comments, complaining, and whining, and sending it off to your buddy who owns a peptide company who sells out of the back of his gym. Listen, DEP, yes, I'm in one of those moods again. Dip is a nonipeptide, non amino acids. That's all you need to know. But here's where most people stop. They read sleep peptide and then the brain goes and just falls asleep and they think it it's melatonin with a master's degree. But you couldn't be more wrong. Listen, here's where biology gets interesting with DIP. It's a neurom modulator. 1974 Russian researchers 1974 discovered this isolated it from rabbit brains of all things during sleep. They called it a sleep inducing peptide because that's what they measured. That's not what it is. That's what they measured. But that it's the same reason we call hemoglobin oxygen even though it's so much more than that. Dip it, listen, just hear me out, okay? Because this is the kind of brain I have. This is how it works. Dip is a peptide hormone that acts on tons of receptor systems all at the same time. It's not this single track molecule. It's this entire conductor of events in your system. And the event is every system in your body that determines whether you are going to die very young or you are going to live very old and wrinkly. That's literally what DIP works on. It crosses the blood brain barrier, binds to specific receptors in your hypothalamus, your pituitary throughout your entire CNS and PNS, central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. But here, listen carefully. It doesn't just make you sleepy. It doesn't just make you sleepy, you guys. It does something so much more sophisticated than that. Dip modulates metabolic rate. It modulates thermogenesis. It modulates cardiovascular function, neuroendocrine signaling again. Shonenberg 1984, 10 years later proved all this. It's like giving your mitochondria their superintendent back. Like that's how effective this stuff is. And yet people will argue about this. The research is it's black and white. People think sleep peptides do one thing. Sleep. People think DIP does one thing. Sleep. Wrong. Just so you know, sleep, and I said this before, sleep is a symptom. It's a symptom of what DIP is actually doing. It's like the flag that you stuck in the sand. The real work happens when you are out cold. Listen, here's the physiology. When DIP levels are optimal, your body enters what's called parasympathetic dominant state, which means that your vag nerve, 10th cranial nerve that controls like 75% of your parasympathetic nervous system, lights up like New Year's Eve, Time Square, goes bananas. And then what happens? Your heart rate variability improves. Your insulin sensitivity climbs, your growth hormone secretion increases, your inflammatory markers nose dive. Your testosterone production stabilizes, your cortisol pattern optimizes and normalizes the way it's supposed to. And that's just in the beginning of when you take this. But here's what separates DIP from these sleep supplements on the market. Listen, it doesn't just suppress wakefulness. It actively promotes anabolic state. It's like the difference between turning off your alarm clock and I don't know building an actual reason to sleep. So if you look at Aaylor's 1986 he showed that dip excuse me growth hormone secretion by 60%. 60 not through suppressing smatastatin not through forcing your pituitary through direct neuroendocrine modulation. Think just think about what that means. When you sleep, you're not just resting, you're building, repairing, you're literally getting younger at the cellular level. That is not sleep optimization in my books. That is faking longevity. That is standing on the skinny pedal of longevity. Let me break down the most beautiful, most elegant piece of this biochemistry that exists with this molecule. Dip works, like I said, multiple mechanisms, right? So, look at neuroendocrine signaling. binds to receptors in your super kyazmic nucleus which is like the master clock of your entire body. But this isn't about melatonin. Melatonin is the announcement that it's dark, right? Dip is the program that makes your body reorganize itself for recovery which is required. So when DIP hits those SCN receptors, supercasmic nucleus, it starts this thing called circadian phase adjustment. Your body's internal clock doesn't just shift to sleep mode. It shifts to regen mode. regeneration, right? So, Kajama 2001 showed this is one of my favorite studies that dies directly influences influences hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function by reducing abnormal cortisol secretion patterns. That means it doesn't suppress cortisol. That would be bad by the way. It stabilizes, harmonizes it. So your morning cortisol spike happens, your evening decline happens, but instead of the disregulation that is created by this chaotic social media governed world that we live in, right? Cortisol fires up at midnight and you're exhausted by noon, your body actually remembers how to rhythm. Look at mitochondrial function because this is where it gets really wild. Your mitochondria, we already know this, power plants of your cell. Every cell in your body needs a denazine triphosphate to function. ATP is literally the stored energy currency of every single thing in your body. The three phosphate bonds holding nothing but potential. Baby, that's how it works. So, when you're tired, stressed, inflamed, old, you're listen, I'm 52. I can say it. I'm old. Your mitochondria, they're essentially broken. They're not producing ATP efficiently. It's like asking my diesel truck, my 2500 out there to just run on vapor fumes. So DIP directly enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorilation which is the process of where your mitochondria convert nutrients into usable energy. How it's a master class how it increases expression of something called PGC1 alpha. This is the regulating control system of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Think of it as you you're hiring a bunch more workers and you're also making sure that those workers are very well trained. It enhances expression of uncoupling protein 2 which regulates the efficiency of ATP production while reducing RO reactive oxygen species. Those these are the free radicals that age you. Stressova 1995 proved this. It upregulates suinate dehydrogenase and cyto cytochrome C oxidase. These are the enzymes that actually make the etc the electron transport chain do its freaking job. So here practical terms dip makes your mitochondria produce more energy with less waste. That is without any fancy explanation metabolic youth pretty much the opposite of aging in my opinion. Look at the neuro look at the neuroimmune modulation. Dip induces or dip directly influences thymic function. So your thymus is here and now let me get to this. You need to understand this because your thymus goes garbage very quickly. And T excuse me T- cell production. The thymus is your im it's your immune command center. Produces tea cells which are the kill squad of your entire immune system. They find viral infections and degenerative proteins and cancer cells. Here's the tragedy of aging. Your thymus shrinks, atrophies like a some [ __ ] So by age 60, most people's thymus is functionally gone and replaced by this other thing called fat. So what does is single is it signals your thymus to stay active. It's like putting your immune system back on alert, but it's not very crude. It's very precise. It doesn't hyperactivate your immune system because that creates an autoimmunity issue. Instead, it creates immune competence. It makes it smarter and more vigilant. So, the ability to respond to threats while maintaining tolerance, which is required. Look at the antioxidant cascade activation. This is important because antioxidants keep you alive. So when DIP binds to its receptors, it activates what's called the NRF2 pathway, nuclear factor 2 related factor 2. This is your antioxidant response element. Yes, you need to know this. NRF2 is it's like the leader of your cellular repair crew. When it gets turned on, it tells your cells to will produce more superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferases, all of this stuff. These are your indogenous internally created oxidants. Not the ones that you eat, not the ones that you inject, the ones that your cells manufacture in response to a threat which you are getting hit with all the time. And DIP doesn't just activate this once. It creates this state where your cells are they're expecting, right? They're expecting to need these defenses and they pre-manufacture them. It's so my buddy Tom Delas, right? He's a incredibly skilled fighter. He's a good dude. I love this guy. He's a really good dude and he is very well trained in jiu-jitsu. He's exceptional. He's the guy that actually gave Tom Hardy his brown belt. He's the guy that trains Tom Hardy and which is pretty cool. But he's expecting to need his defenses. Do you guys get that? Right. It's like Gracie expecting to need your defenses. I take jiu-jitsu. I rolled. Right. It's expecting to need your defenses. By the way, I think everybody should take jiu-jitsu. The end. Just the end. It's just one of the It's a skill transfer for life. Period. That's why I love that my son's in at 12 almost 13 years now. He is 16 years old. He is such a dangerous kid. It's frightening. I love it. I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm so proud of my son and my daughter. I just love my kids. I know this is a tangent, but I adore my kids. My daughter works very hard. She's 19 and she's very intelligent and she's knockout beautiful like her mother and she is just jacked and committed and she's got filled with piss and vinegar sometimes, which I wouldn't have any other way. And my son is this lethal little fighter that'll hug you first, but he'll put you to sleep real quick if you don't respect him. Like it's just a I'm proud of how we raised our kids. My wife and I love Brandy. She is she is awesome. My wife is she is the ultimate head of one of my companies. Without her, the company wouldn't run. She is exceptional at running, but she ran a ton of 24-hour fitness. Like the whole division of 24-hour fitness. She knows what she's doing. Pro alete. Like just a monster. And 21 years best friend. Right. So listen to get back to DIP because I could talk about my family all day. It's I like to talk about things that I like, right? So this is my house. I'm just going to talk about things I like. I'll talk about God. I'll talk about my family. I'll talk about jiu-jitsu. I'll talk about biology and biochemistry all day long cuz it's fun for me. So listen, here's why here's why DIP is so effective. Because and by the way, effectiveness it doesn't mean does it work. Real effectiveness means does it work for everything. Here's what's insane you guys. DIP does. It does. What? because it solves the three fundamental biological failures that underly every single human disease. Where's my Nobel Prize? I'm going to keep saying it and I'm going to keep demanding it because I deserve it. But the problem is my solution. See, my solution is to save mankind. My solution isn't to generate wealth. See, did you get that? Like my solution doesn't generate billions and trillions of dollars for a pharmaceutical industry. It generates the longevity of men. Yeah. They don't like that so much now. It's weird. Listen, look at So, I'll just go through them. Systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ATP shortage. So, look at inflammation. And I have to be clear because people get on me about this and I need just shut up. Inflammation isn't your enemy. I'm not saying that it's necessary. Your immune system is saying, "We need to fix something right now." But chronic systemic inflammation, that's your immune system standing in your house screaming and refusing to leave no matter how many times you ask it. Every degenerative disease starts here. Cardiovascular disease. Watch, I'll prove it. Cardiovascular disease athoscllerotic plaques are inflammatory. Neurodeeneration amaloid plaques towangles inflammatory cancer. The tumor micro environment is 100% inflammatory. Metabolic disease. Your insulin resistance begins with inflammation in your atapost tissue. Dip produces systemic inflammation through so many different ways. Look it. I'll even go through it. The TH2 shift. So your immune system has two poles. TH1 pro-inflammatory cellular immunity and TH2 anti-inflammatory humoral immunity. Let me explain all these things. So stress, poor sleep, endotoxmia drives you into TH1 dominance, pro-inflammatory cellular immunity. So your immune system is constantly in it's got radar on, right? Just looking for something to attack. It's in attack mode. Dip creates TH2 polarization, right? So Mrron explained this very well in 1989. It doesn't suppress the TH1. You don't want to do that. It just tips the balance towards tolerance and anti-inflammatory signaling, which is how you're supposed to run. Look at the IL10 production. This is the second variation of this. DEIP stimulates interlucan 10 production. IL10 is the it's like the chill out cytoine. It's when it's what tells your immune system that the threat is gone. You're okay. You're safe. And normally your body produces IL10 as a break on inflammation. But in chronic disease, somebody cut the brakes. This should be a Magna Pi episode, right? Like it just they snip the brakes, you go cleaning off the cliff in Honolulu. Dip rebuilds the brake system and connects up the lines. Okay, look at the NFCappa B suppression. So NFCappa B is the ultimate inflammatory transcription factor. When it's activated, your cells, they just churn out pro-inflam pro-inflammatory cytoines, TNF, alpha, 6, DIP doesn't block NFCappa brutally because that would suppress listen that would suppress very necessary immunity. Instead, it modulates it through a ton of different directions. It includes inhibitor cappa B regulation, which keeps NFCappa B sequestered and slightly inactive when it shouldn't be firing. It does this very effectively because it's not doing it in a way that suppresses function. It's doing it in a way that modulates function. They're not the same. But here's the result. The inflammation drops, blood vessel function improves, your immune system becomes a very precise attack system the way it's designed instead of this panicked reactive what we've labeled autoimmune and autoimmune system a dysfunction system which is not true. I don't I just really don't believe there's anything there's any such thing as an autoimmune disorder. I believe there is a response to a terrible ecosystem inside your physiology and I've proven it with my three biological failures. Give me an autoimmune disease and I will tear it apart and I will show you and I'll prove it and I'll solve it. How about that? I've already solved lupus. What else you got? Fibromyalgia. I did that. Psoriasis, eczema. I could do this all day. Because once you understand biology, you can solve the problems. Look at insulin resistance. It's the metabolic corruption that starts almost every single chronic disease. Because here's the physiology. Insulin is a signaling hormone. It tells your cells you need to take up glucose because you need it. When your cells stop listening, that's why I said they're deaf, right? They become insulin resistant. Glucose piles up in your bloodstream, your pancreas, flips out, and it pumps out even more insulin, which makes your cells even more insulin resistant, which leads to type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, massive cognitive decline. But they're not going to treat that. If you have type 2 diabetes, you are going to get Alzheimer's. It's that simple. And I will stand by that conviction. It's why it's called type 3 diabetes, assass. But stop thinking that type 2 diabetes is something to sneeze at. 100% user created. You did that to yourself, which means you can unwind it. Yes, it is reversible. ESIP fixes the insulin resistance at the root. It does it like this. Mitochondrial improvements. Mitochondrial improvement gives improved insulin signaling. Let me explain. So, insulin resistance starts with mitochondrial dysfunction. When your mitochondria can't produce adenazine triphosphate efficiently, they instead produce something else, reactive oxygen species. Now the reactive oxygen species damage the insulin signaling cascade at the receptor level. DEIPP enhances mitochondrial function. Better mitochondria, less reactive oxygen species, preserved insulin signaling. I think the problem with most diseases is they're looking for complex answers because people want complex answers because it gives them something to fail at. Look at the adypine modulation. Your fat cells are endocrine organs whether you like it or not. They secrete hormones. Epineectin resistant, TNF alpha, leptin. When you're inflamed, weird failure one. Your fat cells produce more inflammatory atypocines and less adopeneectin which is the protective adopine. Dip shifts this more adopeneectin less inflammatory atypocines. So adopeneectin directly enhances insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver. Kajyama showed that 2001 same study I used earlier. Look at the direct glucose uptake enhancement that this provides. Dip enhances glute 4 transllocation where the glucose transporters, this is what it does. Jo, I'll explain it. Relax. It they migrate to the cell membrane and allow glucose uptake. This happens in skeletal muscle during dip enhanced sleep state. So more glucose uptake, remember this is the sink. Your muscles are the sink that you can flush glucose down. It's the biggest one you've got. But more glucose uptake, lower blood glucose, preserve pancreatic function, and the ultimate answer is reversed insulin resistance. this stuff. I could do this all day. Look at the ATP shortage. This is the foundation of the entire damn thing. You have 37 trillion cells in your body and each one needs ATP. Every single one. Your mitochondria produce about your body weight of ATP in every single day. When mitochondria fail, energy fails. When energy fails, you ready? Here's the ultimate disgusting answer to that. When your energy fails, everything fails. Dip directly enhances ATP production. Look at complex one, two, three, and four upregulation. I'll show you. The electron transport chain has four protein complexes. Nicely five. But they pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane creating a gradient. ATP synthes, the turbine at the end, complex 5. Essentially uses that gradient to phosphorolate, screw a phosphate onto ADP and turn it into ATP. EIP increases expression and function of all four complexes. Look at the substrate availability. It increases glucose uptake by glute 4 transllocation and enhances lipolysis, fat mobilization. But it does this all while you're sleeping, which is why I said when you're sleeping, you're regenerating. You're not just resting. This means that your mitochondria have this constant fuel carbohydrates and fats. Nutritional redundancy, by the way, creates what's called energy resilience. Look at uncoupling protein optimization. Here's the balance. You want ATP production, but you also want heat, which is thermogenesis. These are opposing forces. You get maximum ATP production and optimal thermogenesis. Here's the problem. Most of the time it's a very energy wasteful system. But this is you do it without wasting any energy. Look at the neurology behind DIP because this will change how you look at this forever. DCIP doesn't just improve general health. It solves neurological problems that modern medicine considers this. I this pisses me off. Considers it progressive. I got to sit like this cuz it's my back is hurting. You can see I'm dancing around here and my podcast like I'm having a little I don't know hanging out here dancing in my own little personal club. You should see this place. It looks awesome in here. But it it solves this is the progressive and inevitable issues that modern medicine says, but that's not true. So I I'll show you why and how this is solved. And I'll even explain it using basic physiology. Look, the bloodb brain barrier. Okay, DIP crosses the bloodb brain barrier. This is huge because most peptides don't. Your bloodb brain barrier is very selective because your brain is this sacred piece of gray matter. It doesn't let trash through. If it does, you've got big problems. desent crosses because it's a non-eptide with very specific amino acid sequences that make it bloodb brain barrier permeable. Okay, it it doesn't matter what it is. I could get into D amino acids. I guess it doesn't really make a difference once it's there. Here's where DIP goes to work. It restores cortical rhythm. This is so huge. Your brain works on rhythms. I don't care you guys. We are in this hyper always I'm not going to say hustle culture because I love hustle but this I will take everything I can. If you've seen playd date where he you know what's her name goes Ivy's got speed, right? That's the world. We're living on speed and that's not okay because you lose cortical rhythm like that and you wind up trashing your system. Doctors should help people do this. This is why I'm here cuz I love you. I absolutely freaking love you. So these aren't poetic, these rhythms. They're electrical. So your cortical system generates oscillations at these different frequencies. Delta waves, theta waves, alpha waves, all this stuff. Gamma waves. Yes, gamma waves. You guys are like, "Oh, I'm going to be the Hulk. Relax." No. But when you age, when you're stressed, when you have neurodeeneration, all of you guys with we're talking MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia, all this stuff, these rhythms break. So your EEG becomes what's called this rhythmic. It's chaotic. It's like the leader of the band, what's Steve Tyler from Aerosmith is up there singing and all a sudden he decides to check out and you have Luciano Pavarati trying to sing as Steve Tyler and the band is like, "What the [ __ ] is going on?" Both incredible singers in my opinion, by the way. though just before you guys start judging me I think paparati and Steve pilot are both incredible but dstip restores the leader of the band right two mechanisms gammaurgic tone so dip and I'll go through these one by one it enhances gabaurgic signaling at your cortex specifically the phalamus which is the gateway to your cortex yes I'm fidgety right now because my back is bugging me sitting here it's cuz I did this dumb workout it was so savage I don't even post my workouts anymore I know this is totally off script but it was like I just I went off the reservation Oh, they talk about my workouts, but I just don't post them anymore. Cuz honestly, none of you guys care about my training. I work out really hard. And you know what really happens is a lot of people go, "There's no way you do that." And I used to post full length workouts and sometimes they were an hour and a half, two hours long, and then everybody would start telling me I'm overtraining. I love David Gogggins so much. I think he's such a stud. That guy is mentally unbreakable. And what I really like is when he said, "You have to train first in order to overtrain." And I train hard as a beast. And I don't train like David Gogggins and he doesn't overtrain. So I think I'm okay. He's a Navy freaking SEAL. You better respect that. I don't care who you are. You better respect Marines, SEALs, special forces. My buddy AF, 22 years, right? Kennedy. It's like all these are people that I am actual friends with that are good. I love them to death. They're incredible human beings. All military, right? Navy, I don't care. All of you guys. Mad respect. I'll just leave it at that. So look at where was I? GABA, right? So GABA is your it's the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. This is what happens. My brain just goes nuts. It's like hurting cats in here. Like inside my head is like trying to push a string because my brain never stops. My wife is like 21 years. She's you've been this way the whole time. Yep. And my wife loves the [ __ ] This is what tells neurons to just mellow. Just stand down a little bit. When gabone is optimal, your cortex can generate coherent oscillations. Right? When GABA is deficient, which happens with stress and alcohol, age, certain diseases, your cortex becomes very noisy, which means it's incoherent. Dip essentially rebuilds GABAurgics. Your Shonenberg explained this in 1984. It enhances slowwave sleep. So during slowwave sleep, stage three, stage four, your cortex generates synchronized delta waves. This is where the magic happens. Memory consolidation happens here, by the way. So your brain I love neurology and some of these people that really I understand it really well. I've seen people that like one of my friends Dr. Murphy this guy understands neurology and he makes me look dumb and I understand neurology really well. Your brain cycles through memories encoded during the day, integrates them into these slots, these long-term storage slots and then clears out metabolic waste through something called the glimpmphatic system. It's like pressure washing your brain, right? DIP enhances the duration and the quality of slowwave sleep. It does this by modulating salamic reticular nuclear activity. It's this is the gatekeeper that lets sleep rhythms propagate through the cortex. So more listen, here's the takeaway. Here's the rub. More slowwave sleep, better memory consolidate consolidation. So pay attention because if you're not getting your sleep, and I'm not talking to run out and get a scuba mask and say that's healthy because I think putting a CPAT machine on you is one of the most idiotic things in the world. Hate me, I don't really care. I'm still right. So I'm trying to tell you there's a better way to do this. I'm not saying take Dip. That's not what I'm suggesting either. I'm saying find out what the real problem is. Your real problem isn't lack of scuba equipment. Your real problem is there's something underlying that's causing that. You better figure that out because that's not helping you. Even if you're like, I finally got to sleep with my CPAT machine. Cool. Cool story, bro. So, what are you going to do when that doesn't work? Your systems needed that since the day you were born. No, you've been convinced that you need things to survive. Solve the machine. Solve the ecosystem. Solve the three biological failures. And most of the time, all the things you thought you had to stay on for the rest of your life, you don't. I see this every day in my black card with real patients, real clients, real people I work with because I love them. The end and I give tough love sometimes. I'm like, dude, what you want to do is stupid. Take that and throw it in the trash and do this instead because I care. I love you enough to tell you the truth. So, listen. If you have more slowwave sleep and you get better memory consolidation, you also get better cognitive function, which I'll help you. Here's the takeaway. Delayed neuro or if ever neurodeeneration, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis. Look at this. DIP does something even more incredible because it promotes the creation of neurons and the rewiring of all the existing ones here. It upregulates BDNF, brain derived neurotrphic factor. This is the growth hormone for your brain. This stuff is so wicked like Cax cerebral all of this stuff. You need to understand this, okay? It tells neurons to grow, to connect, to survive. So many studies, DIP admin administration increases DDNF levels in the hippocampus. So many studies show this. But here's why this matters. Because the hippocampus is where all those new memories are encoded. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus is the foundation of learning and memory. So you got to string this together. Dip tells your brain keep building baby. So BDNF activates TRKB receptors on neurons which activates P13K AKT pathway which promotes synaptogenesis dendritic spine density that's the connection points between neurons mitochondrial density which is energy for neural transmission antioxidant defense which is protection from those things that punch holes in your cells and your life called reactive oxygen species look at adult this is such a wicked thing neurogenesis okay your brain doesn't stop making this no matter what I'm tired of people saying Your brain does not stop making new neurons after childhood. It continues doing this throughout your entire life. Two specific areas to be honest. Subvententricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The hippocampus dip promotes proliferation of neuroprogenitor cells in these zones. Okay, watch. Here's what happens. Cognitive decline reverses. Memory improves. Learning becomes easier. Neuroplasticity returns. Do you know that DIP protects against exytoxicity? And just so you know what that is, it's what kills neurons. Excessive excessive glutamate. To be honest, it's the easiest way to explain it. Excessive glutamate demolishes your neurons. And what do they give you? Something to reduce glutamate, not solve the problem about why it's high in the first place. Glutamate is your primary excitatory neurotransmitter. It's necessary, but when it builds up, which happens with inflammation, stress, mitochondrial failure, it becomes toxic. Neurons fire themselves to death. They go nuts and they burn out. DIP protects against this glutamate re-uptake enhancement. And so DEIP re DEIPP regulates EAA2. This is the glutamate vacuum cleaner. It sucks up excess glutamate out of the syninnapse and back into the gal cells. More glutamate reuptake, less excytotoxicity, neuronal survival. Calcium homeostasis. So excytoxicity, just so you know, works through calcium. Excess glutamate opens NMDA and AMA receptors. Calcium floods in like we're talking like a tsunami. Calcium activates proteasis and phospholipases that destroy your neurons. Dip enhances calcium buffering capacity in neurons. So here's what happens and here's how. Increased mitochondrial calcium uptake. Enhanced cycoplasmic and endopplasmic reticulum calcium ATPA's function. I realize I'm going hard into biochemistry and pardon me as I want to stop but this is a master class. You need to understand this. Upregulation of calbindin and calretin which are calcium binding proteins. So here's the takeaway. more calcium control, neuronal survival, neuronal survival. It's it provides this insane antioxidant to fights. Excytoxic calcium influx generates reactive oxygen species, damages lipids, proteins, and your DNA. Dip activates NRF2, which I already talked about. Your neurons manufacture more, right? Endogenous indogenous indogenous antioxidants. It manufactures more superoxide dismutase, catalates, glutathione. So if you guys are all like, oh, I got to take my glutathione, you can also make your own. You know that. But when you have better antioxidant defense, you get long-term neuronal survival. Look at some neurological conditions. Just let me be direct on DIP and explain how this works. Look at dementia and Alzheimer's. So Alzheimer's is fundamentally mitochondrial disease with neuroinflammation. Right? And I've explained this. I've even solved it. The classic pathology amaloid beta plaques and towangles. But the problem isn't the amaloid beta and the tow. It's why they develop. Those are what do I call them? The tombstones. That's the flag. That's the thing that's going this is what's going on. But that's not what's causing it. That's like treating. Remember what I said? It's like trying to treat the smoke. Put out the fire here. This is what causes this entire shitow called dementia. Mitochondrial dysfunction generates reactive oxygen species. Damaged proteins misfold. Reactive oxygen species are what damage these proteins. Misfolded proteins aggregate. The aggregation triggers inflammation and the inflammation drives more mitochondrial dysfunction. It is this ugly vicious cycle. You can distill this down to systemic inflammation, insulin resistance. They're starving. Not like MS where there's a kink in the system, but when the vascular, it's a vascular insufficiency and ATP shortage. You have mitochondrial dysfunction. Watch. Which is what I just explained. So, by restoring mitochondrial ATP production and reducing reactive oxygen species, here's what happens. You reduce amalloid beta generation. So less reactive oxygen species, less protein damage, less aggregation. Right? It enhances the glimpmphatic clearance which is the pressure washer for your brain. Better sleep rhythms, better metabolic waste clearance, amaloid. So just see you wondering what I'm getting at. Reduces neuroinflammation. It does this through the TH2 shift and the 10 production which I talked about earlier on in this podcast. It promotes neurogenesis which is done through BDNF primarily brain derived neurotrophic factor the the miracle grow. If you look at this, look, here's what's wild. Shonenberg in 1994 showed that Dip administration restored cognitive function and reduced markers of oxidative stress in your brain. So, if I'm going to look at something that's going to get in the way of potential future neuro degenerative or cognitive decline, I'm going to put my money dip. I could do this with Parkinson's. I could do this with multiple sclerosis. I'm just I'm not going to. There's just too much. I could do this for days. But here's where most people get DIP wrong. It's the more is better thing. And I've had people do this even in my group. I'm going to take more. Why? Well, if I take one, then two has to be better. But the law of diminishing returns happens. And what ends up happening is you get minimal positive feedback from it, but you get hundreds [snorts] of like orders of magnitude more negative effects. Don't do that. If anything, Redat True Tide proved that the difference between 4 millig and 8 millig was a 5% increase in weight loss and a 300% increase in side effects. But the instab bros, don't get mad. I'm out here to help you. If you're one of those insta bros, maybe just take notes and instead of trying to sell more of your product, try and sell more health. Try and actually take care of the people you purport to talk to to just love so much. But everything has an affiliate code. Do you know that everything that I post, like you'll get a link somewhere on my copy underneath this video? It's not a funnel. There's nothing in it that's a funnel. There's a link to Elite Biogenics. Well, duh. Only an idiot. What do you think? I'm going to put a link to somebody else's stuff. But I give you the answer. I don't even ask for anything in return. I go, if you want to get it, here's an easy way to find it. I give a link. I give the apply@unlockthecard.com to work with Dr. Trevor cuz I get thousands of emails from you guys every day going asking me for advice, which I legally can't do. So, you want to work with me, join the black card. But I don't put you into funnels, man. I'm out here because I genuinely am going to save all of mankind and all their health because that's what God is giving me the power to do. That's not me, man. This is all coming down, right? I'm not doing this. And I will never take credit for this. I am a tool that is being used to help you guys. That's it. Look it. [clears throat] When you stimulate a receptor constantly, it downregulates. The receptor becomes less sensitive. You need to understand this. This is called typhilaxis tolerance. When you take DIP every single day for 6 months, your receptors will be giving you the finger and downregulating. You'd be taking it for 30% of the benefit that you're getting. At best, you need to cycle it. 10 days on, 5 days off, or 5 weeks on, 2 weeks off. There you go. You're welcome. And I never do this in these podcasts. Why? Because they always get me in trouble. Watch. Here's why this works, by the way. Because in this off period, your receptors upregulate again. They become more sensitive. your endogenous desip production which gets suppressed with exogenous outside administration recovers and your body's own anti-homeostatic mechanism. They all reset. So you come back to day one with receptors that are going, "Yeah, give me more. I'm ready. I'm ready." This is why this is why every protocol for the most part outside of a very select few for a very specific case should be cycled cuz it's just better for you. Now before you go, didn't you say there's some forever peptides? I sure did. But like I said, specific circumstances, specific peptides. Here's the other reason. Negative feedback. When you take endogenous or when you take exogenous DIP outside in, your hypothalamus goes, "Okay, we've got enough." And it downregulates endogenous desip production, your own production. You do this for months and your body goes, "I don't even know how to do this anymore. It's not like riding a bike. Cycling prevents this. It keeps your indogenous production intact and it makes sure that it understands the rules of the game. This is the difference between supplementation actually and dependency. You know what you want to you want to see something wild? I wasn't going to talk about this. I touched on it a little bit in my podcast or in my Instagram post. Look at menopause. I got to do this cuz it's making me crazy. I just got to help you people. Menopause is not normal aging. I'm tired of people going it's just normal. No, it's not. And it's normal. So you can sell your book, your medication, your products, your pills, your hormones, your patches, your vag, your pellets, your secrets, your secret protein hack where if you just have enough protein, you don't have any issues with menopause. All this is [ __ ] I'm not saying take what I'm selling, by the way, before somebody goes, "Oh, your method works." No. What I'm telling you is that's all a lie. My grandma didn't have crazy Perry and menopause symptoms. Why? because she was her biology was functioning right just like most other people that are in their 90s. Right. Listen, when estrogen and progesterone drop, which they do during menopause, women lose cardiovascular protection because estrogen maintains endothelial function, the lining inside the vessels. Neurop protection because estrogen enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor and mito mitochondrial function. Bone protection because estrogen maintains bone mineral density. Osteoblasts versus osteoclasts, right? Thermal regulation. Estrogen regulates hypothalamic temperature set point so you burn more fat. Metabolic stability. Estrogen enhances insulin sensitivity. Dip addresses menopause through all of these and it does it independent to estrogen. Look at the hypothalamic G&R modulation that it does. So it reduces dysriythmia and that cause the hot flashes. Let me explain how this works. Hot flashes aren't they're not random. They're caused by this ridiculously goofy G&RH pulse that triggers the luteinizing hormone surge and which is what causes the vasoddilation. Deep normalizes G&RH pulsatility and it shuts down the hot flashes by 60%. Kajama in 2001 came out and said, "Look at this. Look what it's doing." And yet people are like, "I don't know. Maybe I should get a cream." Are you crazy? What if you don't have to? What if you just get your system to do what it's supposed to do? You're welcome. That's part one. This hair on my mustache is making me crazy. It protects your mitochondria. directly enhances mitochondrial function independent of estrogen, which protects neurons from the sudden loss of estrogen's mitochondrial support. If you understood that little list that I just gave you, menopausal women show accelerated cognitive decline. You go into a room, you forget why you're there 5 seconds after, it's not to be insulting, you get brain fog. It's part of this issue, but it's not supposed to be like this. Okay? Dip directly protects against this through BDNF and mitochondrial enhancement. Look at the cardiovascular protection. This one's going to blow your mind. Estrogen tanks. Cardiovascular risk goes up. DIP enhances endothelial nitric oxide production, improves coronary blood flow, and vastly reduces atheroscllerotic risk independent of estrogen. 2001, Kajama showed that women on DIP during menopause had improved cardiovascular parameters and lipid profiles. Huh? But you probably don't want to take this. Look at the bone protection. Estrogen loss equals bone loss. DIP doesn't replace estrogen. If that's what you're hearing, you need to check your hearing because that's not what I'm saying. Here's what it does. It enhances, remember what I talked about, osteoblast, osteoclass. So osteoblast, bone building cell function. It enhances that and it reduces osteoclast, bone destroying cell activity. It improves mineral metabolism. It reduces inflammation which drives bone loss. The result is this. Menopause becomes something you can navigate. Bone loss slows down. cognitive function goes up. Cardiovascular risk doesn't spike. Your system runs the way it's designed. Look at the HPTA axis and all the recovery that it controls. Okay, this is a command center for male reproductive endocrinology. Okay, just follow me on this one before you like, wait, what? Just follow me. When you train hard, you suppress appetite, stress, or use certain drugs, which you probably shouldn't be doing. You suppress the HBTA, but testosterone goes tits up. DIP supports HPTA recovery. Watch. Restores G&RH. It normalizes the pulsatility. Constant GH suppression. Constant G&RH suppresses luteinizing hormone. Pulsatile G&R stimulates luteinizing hormone. Follow me. DIP creates that pulsatility allowing luteinizing hormone recovery. It reduces cortisol antagonism. So elevated cortisol, it doesn't matter by how, by the way, suppresses G&R. It also suppresses luteinizing. This antagonizes testosterone at the tissue level. So, DIP normalizes cortisol patterns. This is what I talked about, right? You don't wake up at midnight and get sleepy at noon because your cortisol doesn't know what the hell it's doing. It does this through H, like I said at the beginning, HPA axis modulation. It removes the break on your testosterone in the in the process. This is why this stuff is so fantastic. And before you go, well, is this the magic pill? No. You also can't eat like an [ __ ] train like you like you don't train. You sit around and you play Call of Duty all day in your mom's basement at 45. You need to actually take responsibility for your health. But this is for doctors and health care professionals that should actually go maybe I should be all about actually doing health, not selling my product or service. I don't give a crap if you buy from me. I care that you actually buy from you, which means your mindset to be a healthy human being. Look at the recovery capacity this stuff does. DEIPP enhances [clears throat] sleep quality, sleep duration, and parasympathetic tone. Okay, these are the conditions under which testosterone is produced primarily during sleep by the way boys and recovered after suppression. Better sleep, better testosterone recovery. The end. You really want to go good from good to great. You ready? Dip hypothetically epitoolon and mc. You're welcome. No, I can't go into the details before at least you give me the dosage. No, I can't. Why? Because we live in a world that doesn't want you to be healthy governed by people that work for big pharma and the FDA. That's why. Look at here. Here's just watch. DIP enhances cortical rhythms and sleep architecture. A epitoolon activates timmerase and restores pineal melatonin production. And M C enhances mitochondrial function needed to support circadium rhythm maintenance. There you go. You know what happens? Your circadian rhythm becomes so friaking solid, robust, it's almost unshakable, jet lag daily that you have is gone and sleep becomes pretty much bulletproof. You're welcome. Listen, the secret about DIP isn't how it works. It's why it works when nothing else does. Because it's not about one mechanism. It's about signal integrity. Here's what I mean. Your body is this giant signaling organism. [snorts] My nose is driving me nuts, too. Every single thing that happens, every protein you make, every cell you make, every thought you have, every heartbeat, every neurological function that you have, every hormone that you secrete, every cell that lives or dies is based on signals. Period. When you age, when you get sick, when you have neurodeeneration, what's actually happening is massive signal corruption. Your cells are getting the wrong message at the wrong time. Yes, you're still supposed to die, but it's not supposed to happen at 45 and then you just hang on under managed decline until you're 85. That's not normal. Look at inflammation gives this constant attack signal even if there's no threat. Mitochondrial dysfunction gives constant energy crisis signals. Neurodeeneration gives constant protein misfold signals. Your cells are listening to a bunch of radios that are playing static. DIP is the cleaner. It solves the problem. It works through so many damn pathways that not because it's doing a bunch of unrelated things, but because it's restoring baseline signal integrity, so your biology actually works because it's turning off the damn noise. When the noise goes down, your immune system hears real threats instead of the phantom ones, so it doesn't go nuts. Your metabolic system hears recover instead of crisis and panic. your neurological system. Here's build and connect instead of degrade and withdraw and decay, which is why DIP helps so many different conditions. It's not some magic bullet, by the way. It is signal restoration. When you restore signals, everything downstream gets restored. This is what the This is, listen, all these this is what pisses me off about current med school and current medical doctors. This is what pisses me off about the pharmaceutical industry. Like I said, I don't give a crap if you buy from me or not. I'm not trying to shill my stuff and sell my stuff and I have no desire to sit there go, I'm so right and make a reaction video. I'm here because I actually care. This is what the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to understand because they can't patent signal restoration. You can't you can only patent specific drugs that address all the stuff downstream. DIP. Dip. Are you kidding me? Dip addresses all the upstream causes. Good lord. If you would have listened to my Kiss Pepin video, but your brains would have exploded because it's so fantastic. Listen, let me let me reframe this entire conversation before I go inside and eat. The average person thinks DIP makes you sleep better. Sleep is good. Raw. Therefore, sleep therefore dip is good. It's true, but it's radically. I need some Snoopy coffee. This is It's a longevity peptide. Listen, I'll just let me explain it. Okay. Reduces mortality risk and extends health span years of quality life, by the way. improves functional capacity with age. It preserves cognition. It prevents age related disease. Maintains metabolic health. Dip does all of this stuff. And yet people look at it and go, "I think I'll take some creatine." Listen, creatine is badass. By the way, I should probably do a podcast on all of this cuz it's very effective. It's just right up there with coffee in my books. But all of this stuff is good not because it improves sleep. It's good because improving sleep is where all the other stuff happens. mitochondrial repair, lymphatic clearance, immune optimization, protein synthesis. Sleep, you guys, sleep is where you get younger. It's not in a surgeon's office. It's not with a face cream. It's when you're asleep. Dip doesn't just make sleep happen. It makes deep sleep and regenerative sleep happen over years and years. That compounds a person taking DIP off and on for a decade. Watch. Better preserved mito mitochondrial function, lower chronic inflammation, better cognitive function, lower cardiovascular risk, better metabolic function, way lower cancer risk. Pretty much you're going to live longer, healthier, and better. That's a longevity peptide. Listen, let me put a bow on this and go inside cuz it's been an hour. It's a long time. It's not a production system. It's not a performance system. It's a repair system. That's your body. And I know everybody talks about high performance machines, but you're a repair machine. Sleep, exercise, think, eat, sex, walking, building is either supporting or suppressing repair. In in modern life, most of modern life suppresses repair. Watch this. Look it. Dysriythmic living kills repair. Mitochondrial dysfunction kills repair. Inflammation kills repair. Insulin resistance kills repair. Chronic stress kills repair. Poor sleep kills repair. You age because your repair capacity collapses. Dip is a repair enabler. Enhances sleep. Reduces inflammation. enhances mitochondrial function, optimizes hormone signaling, activates antioxidant defenses, which protects repair capacity, and over time, what did I just say? This compounds like crazy and your repair systems come back online. You stop aging and you start anti-aging. You start anti-aging. Listen, DIP is not a sleep supplement. It's a longevity molecule that works through sleep. You need to understand that fundamental difference. It addresses the three fundamental biological failures of all disease. inflammation, insulin resistance, and ATP shortage. It solves neurological problems by restoring signal incre integrity and promoting neurogenesis. Solves metabolic symptoms. It solves metabolic problems by fixing your damn mitochondria. Solves hormone problems by restoring your circadian rhythm and HPA, HPT axis function. It solves cardiovascular problems by restoring endothelial function. It solves aging itself because aging is fundamentally a repair system failure. And when you combine it with things, let's say hypothetically for your kangaroo like a pitilon and mi, you create this trilogy of longevity that addresses telmir shortening, circadian rhythm restoration, and mitochondrial biogenesis at the same time. That is not supplement optimization. That is called anti-aging. Listen, the reason that you're not going to hear this pushed in mainstream, it's not because it doesn't work. It's because it's not profitable to cure aging. It's not profitable for Joe medical student or Sally medical student or Joe MD or Mr. Instab bro or Mrs. Instab Bro or soccer mom selling this out of their basement. It's not profitable. They want you to buy their stuff, not buy your biology. Disease management is very pisses me off to be honest. Above all, do no harm. I'm not out here to get you to buy my stuff. I really don't have anything to sell you. You decide. You want to join the black card? Great. You want to buy from me? Great. Either way, I got nothing to sell you. I want you to have the information. But now, you know what DIP really is. You know how it works. You know why it works. Everything you've been told about sleep supplements has been missing the actual revolution happening at the cellular freaking level. Choice about what you do with this information that I come out here and I give you almost every damn day is up to you. But the information is irrefutable. It's as uninterruptible as freaking gravity. Like this is for you guys. Anyway, I hope you guys got something out of this. I got to go. Never miss.
