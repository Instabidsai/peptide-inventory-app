Five after one Saturday fibromyalgia. I'm not just going to talk about it. I'm going to solve the whole thing. And I'm not going to use the word cure because that is an arrogance. I've been a doctor for decades, decades, and decades. I've seen over a million patients and I continue to help people. And I really don't care what the narrative says or what I should do or what some board says I should do. I help people because that's my job. Above all, do no harm. And it so I think about the current landscape, social media, YouTube, all this stuff. And the censorship that people go, "No, there's no censorship." Yes, there is. And the censorship is against everything that will make you rich, strong, and [clears throat] incredibly healthy, and have a fantastic psychology. You You do understand that. And that's not what this podcast is about. I will deviate from that, but thanks for being here because you don't have to. But I will say this, if you're here to get in my comments and just spew negativity or just be a pharma shill or someone that just decides to argue or give me thumbs down, grow up. Don't come here. You don't need to be here. I solve problems. And if you don't like the solution because you want to argue about it, that doesn't mean that it's not right. My solutions are always right. It's not an arrogance statement. It's a factual statement because I've got a million receipts behind me of people that have all had their problems resolved by listening to Dr. Trevor. And it's because I actually give a crap about the person and I understand human biology, physiology, and biochemistry better than 99.9% of the people on the planet because I make it my job to do that because I want to be the best at this because I care and nobody else is doing that. So, I'm going to solve fibromyalgia from A to Z. Now remember when I come out with these things and I give you the answer, there's more to it than this a lot of times because there's nuances that come into play with your own individual biology or physiology. So just understand that. But for the most part, let's say 95% of the people that have fibro that are going to do this, if you do, welcome to freedom. Like you guys don't understand. You guys have been lied to and not maliciously worse through incompetence through this system that's so broken that it can't see what's right in front of its own face. Like listen, 4 million 4 million plus American women. That's just in one country that modern medicine has essentially gaslit into existence. They've told you guys that it's in your fibromyalgia is in your head, that it's psychological, that the pain isn't real. Are you kidding me? The actual biology, physiology, immunology, excuse me, endocrinology, the biochemistry is screaming the truth. That's it's so loud that anybody paying attention should be embarrassed that we're not talking about this everywhere. And I promise by the end of this podcast, I have no idea how long I'm going to go on this. I told my wife, I said, I'm going out to do this. We fast on Fridays to Saturdays after date night because we want to. I like fasting. It gives me control of my own physiology and my biology, and it taps into autophagy pretty hard, and I feel really good. So, I don't eat until usually around 1 or two on on Saturday. We ate date dinner for date night earlier last night. So, I could have eaten right now, but I thought, nope. I'm going to go out here. I'm going to hammer this out when I'm still all fired up, a little cranky from my from eating. And I'll drink my cup of coffee and I'll drop nothing but bombs to help you guys out and give you all the answers. And then I'm going to go inside. I'm going to eat as many cookies as I can stuff into my bar hole that my wife makes every Saturday and all the great food, the steak, and everything that I have from yesterday. But 4 million Americans, 4 million. 4 million. Like I I want you to understand that by the end of this, that's such a big number, you guys. Because if you look outside in at the 4 million, you go, "Yeah, but that's not a big number." What if you're one of the four million? What if you're one of one? Then all of a sudden, it becomes important because it's everybody looks at problems and says, "They're not important because it's not me." But when it's you want the entire world to bend to you, you know what? I keep coming out here and I keep helping the world because I am going full throttle everything I've got with all the power that God has given me to help save mankind from its own stupidity when it comes to healthcare. I will make sure that you understand what fibromyalgia really is and you'll see how it connects to chronic fatigue syndrome. By the way, they're married and understand the three fundamental biological failures that cause this entire issue and that it's reversible. Like you do understand that everything and none of this is raw motivation. Tony Robbins. I love Anthony Robbins, by the way. I think he's such a stud. I have been listening to Tony Robbins for decades. And I'll tell you, I'm turning off my heater because it's hot as hell in here right now. Although it's 20° outside. I might turn it back on. In case you're wondering what the hell I was reaching down and grabbing, there's a big giant heater next to me. Even though the heat in my studio should be running. I don't know. Texas contractors here can't build worth a damn. And if you're a contractor and you build houses and you think that it's normal to have to turn on your water at 16 degrees. I spent 20 years at Winnipeg, you know how many times I turned on my water to keep my pipes from freezing? Zero. And I never had cold foundations or anything. So don't tell me you guys build good houses here. Texas doesn't know how to build a house worth of [ __ ] It's just doesn't. It's embarrassing. But none of this is Tony Robbins motivation. I'm going to explain how your body actually works. So listen, here's what f fibromyalgia, and I went over this yesterday in social media on Instagram, but here's what it actually is, and I want you to hear this because this is so important. It is not, and I made a shot at rheumatologists because you rheatologists are a bunch of liars because you dismiss it because their blood work looks normal and you say it's a psychological issue and that it's not. It's this is a central sensitization syndrome. I explained it yesterday with multi-system immune neuroendocrine and mitochondrial involvement that they proved in 2024 NIH. That is the actual definition. So, how about I break this down in actual English for the doctors who aren't paying attention to their patients. They're paying attention to their pharmaceutical rep. The body has a pain processing system. It's not just your nerves going, "Ouch, this hurts." It is this sophisticated network. your brain, your spinal cord, your neurotransmitter systems, they all work together to determine what is actually painful. Now, in a normal person, this system is incredibly well calibrated. Trust me. Like you touch something like you put your hand in fire, you move a log around, you put your hand on a stove, that is pain. You something sharp and it sticks into your hand. You touch something like this coffee cup, it I'm just holding the handle. No pain. It's just sensation. The system works and it works very well. In fibromyalgia, the systems gain is cranked up to a billion. And the what that means is it's hyper sensitive. So now your brain is processing non-p painful stimuli as if they're these immense immeasurable threats. So now light touch becomes unbearable. Temperature change is agonizing. The pain threshold drops so low that the system is in this state of hypervigilance. But here's where modern medicine completely fails. They look at this and they say, "We don't see any inflammation in your blood work, so it must be psychological." Are you crazy? That's wrong. 2024, NIH, I'll use the same study, showed fibromyalgia patients have elevated substance P levels three times higher than normal in their cerebral spinal fluid. So now substance P is this excitatory neurotransmitter that says it's screaming the word pain. That's the easiest way to remember it. It just goes pain. That's what it does. So if we're seeing, listen to me. If we're seeing three times normal levels, let me explain this to all the biochemists and want to be successful doctors that aren't because their patients keep giving them the finger because you keep prescribing drugs like gabapentin. We're looking at a genuine neurochemical amplification. It's not it's not psychological. Just so you know, fibro This is crucial. Disregulation of three critical neurotransmitter systems is married to fibromyalgia. Norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin. 2024 PMC proved this. All three are depleted in the spinal cord at the level of the descending anti-nosceptive pathways. What that means is the system that's supposed to turn off the pain and shut it down has gone tits up. It's broken. So, here's the first massive insight. Fibromyalgia is a broken system. The accelerator is floored and the brakes are cut. They don't work. Now, just let me touch on chronic fatigue because you got to understand this because they're married and I have to marry these together because they're the same cause and that's why you need to understand this. Most people think it's just being tired. They think patients are lazy and they think it's depression. So, of course, they bomb you with MAIS and SSRIs. Wrong. Again, listen, CFS characterized by severe persistent immune activation, profound mitochondrial dysfunction. 2024 Exploration Medicine defined that and proved that. But more specifically, CFS, the patients have these measurably reduced NK cell activities, natural killer cells. So down to about half, 2024 PMC, half, let me explain that again. Half of your killer cells, natural killer cells. And just so you know what they are, NK cells are your immune systems assassins. They hunt down infected and cancerous cells, and they're very effective. When they're non-functional, your body can't clean up any of the intracellular pathogens, so you run into problems. CFS, by the way, also involves elevated systemic inflammation. So when they say there's no markers, [ __ ] IL1 beta, TNF alpha, IFNY levels, 2024 PNC. Prove that, too. Your body is running a fever, but it's doing it without the temperature. Your immune system, you guys understand this, your immune system is at war. And here, listen, here's the part that breaks my brain. I need to drink some coffee. If you go to a doctor with with CFS, they might, if you're lucky, they might order basic blood work. This is why when people join, listen, and by the way, before you guys go, "How do I work with you?" Your best bet is to just apply for the black card. You don't need to work one-on-one with me unless you really need one-on-one. One-on-one with me is $250,000 a year, and I take 20 people a year. That's it on purpose because I want to be able to give you time, and I want to be able to devote everything to solving your problem. And I'm very good at what I do. So, is it worth it? No. It's worth significantly more than that because I'll solve your problem. I promise you that. I don't care what it is. Throw it at me. I want to I will obsess on it because I give a [ __ ] But the black card at the end of them today actually is going up to $25,000. It is $9,997 wire transfer only. One year you get access to my live Zoom Q&A call that I do. My private Q&A call that I do on Mondays, not the Sunday webinar call. It's free and I don't do a Q&A there, by the way. Mondays 5:00. I live just east of Dallas, so that's Dallas time, Chicago time, I guess, is the best way to look at it. you get access to the resource library with which has protocols that I've used with patients that actually work. Not these Insta bro, Insta expert, I want to soccer mom, I own a peptide business, stop doing this, start doing that people. These are real things that have worked with real patients thousands and thousands of times. You get access to all of that. You get access to the private VIP community where you can actually message me and I will answer 24 to 72 hours is about my turnaround time because I genuinely look at whatever you send me. I don't care if it's labs or you just I will help you. Give me your whole synopsis, your whole intake, and I'll look at it. That's what it is. You need to pay though to get in. I don't answer questions for free for the most part because otherwise I get inundated with questions and I let you pick my brain for free every time I come out here. If you want to go deeper, yes, I will tell you that you need to work with me because this is also how I take care of my family and that matters to me. And Elite Biogenics, yes, I am the CEO. Yes, if you want to buy from that company, great. If you want to buy from me, I'm thank you very much for supporting my business. If you don't, that's totally okay. I still give you everything. Do I think you should? Yeah, to be honest, I do because what I have in my labs and my warehouses is the same things I would give my wife and kids. So, I trust what I have. So, all these people coming out with their god knows where they get their stuff. And I don't care. Listen, wherever you get it from is up to you. But I do this because I care. I don't do this for the money. And yes, the money. And if you go, well, then you should do it for free. No, because then I don't care. And if you understand that, then you understand a lot about human psychology and why people have value. But listen, if you do, great. And if you want to join the black card, apply at unlockthecard.com. Mia is my executive personal assistant. She is a gangster and she will get you all set up and answer any questions and take care of you and get you the wire information. It's not an email for you guys to send a bunch of questions. She will just direct you to the black card, just so you know. But listen, this stuff really bothers me. What what I'm going to talk about is if you go to a doctor with CFS and they order just the basic blood work, which doesn't make any sense. Your white cell counts, they probably look normal. Your inflammatory markers might be slightly elevated, but WNL within normal li limits, which is such a BS thing to say. Any doctor worth their salt knows those are [ __ ] markers. And then they tell you that it's all in your head. Your chronic fatigue is all in your head. You should meditate and maybe get some tea tree oil and take a trip to Maui or something. But that doesn't make any sense. The problem is they're not measuring what actually matters. They're not measuring metabolic markers. They're not measuring NK cell activity. They're not measuring specific cytoine profiles that characterize the damn disease. They're checking the wrong things, getting normal results, and concluding that the disease doesn't exist. That's like saying, "Hey, listen. My car is making this weird clunking sound in the front end." And they're looking at the exhaust coming out the back and going, "You know what? The car it's it's running. No, no problem. There's nothing wrong with your car." and they've never driven your car to see if it clunks. Like, it's just ridiculous. It's like the check engine light, right? But here's where it gets interesting. Fibromyalgia and CFS, they're not separate diseases. They're expressions of the same underlying biological catastrophe, just different phenotypes. Watch both conditions. You need to understand this because some people are mixing this up. And some people are being characterized or diagnosed with fibromyalgia that don't have fibromyalgia. Like I had somebody say to me, "Hey, listen. Mold can cause fibromyalgia." Wrong. Then it's a mold toxicity problem. It's not fibromyalgia. So, no, it did not cause fibromyalgia. And that's where you have to understand this. These install, you guys are screwing people up. If you're coming out and you're giving people information and you're saying, "This is what it is, and it's a definitive diagnosis. I need to see that the labs like show me the blood work. Show me the whole diagnostic characteristic, the whole intake. I need to see it all because I'm going to call [ __ ] because most of the time you're doing it because you're trying to do what medical doctors do, which is we have been taught to do the same thing, which is treat the symptom, not the cause." I went further down that rabbit hole and I said, "Bullshit. I'm not treating the symptom. I don't care about your symptoms. I care about the cause. So the symptoms go away forever. So look at both conditions. Okay. One, central sensitization, right? Amplified pain fatigue signaling in the CNS. Two, immune dysregulation. This is the marriage that they are these two CFS and fibro, right? Elevated pro-inflammatory cytoines. Reduced regulatory T- cells, NK cell dysfunction, which I just explained. HPA axis. The third thing, HBA access dysfunction. The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. Your body's master stress response system is broken. 2024 plus one. They proved this for mitochondrial dysfunction. Big surprise. Yes, I'm drinking coffee. So, impaired ATP production, elevated ROS, reactivated reactive oxygen species. So, in fibromyalgia, the pain dominates. In CFS, the fatigue dominates, but underneath, same disease, same biology. 2024, they showed fibromyalgia and CFS share the exact same immunopathological features. Elevated IL6, IL8, TNF alpha, reduced regulatory TE-C cells, micro gleal activation, and pain processing regions of the brain. PMC proved it in 2025. They're not different diseases. One is just significantly more painful. The other is significantly more fatiguing. They're siblings. Like they're conjoined twins. So look at this. Every I need to explain this because this is it's bothering me so much that people aren't getting this because if you understand this, it changes everything about disease. Every chronic disease, every single damn chronic disease is three fundamental biological failures every single time. When you master this, you understand everything. I promise. Look at systemic inflammation. Just understand this because it makes me crazy. In fibromyalgia, systemic inflammation is elevated across the damn board. pro-inflammatory cytoines, IL6, IL8, TNF alpha, they're chronically elevated, right? They proved this 2024 PMC. Your immune system isn't responding to a threat. It's just permanently clicked on. It's like the smoke detectors are broken and they're just making nothing but noise. If you've seen that one episode of Duck Dynasty where they're trying to find the smoke detector in the warehouse, it's just going nuts and they finally take it down and Jace decides to smash the piss out of it. So, this is how it is. But there's no fire. So, here's where this comes from. mult multiple places you might the most like leaky gut you might have a gut barrier dysfunction I've seen this so many times leaky gut it's not the it's not the primary though just so you know it's maybe 10% disbiotic microbiota chronic stress that drives mass cell activation most of the time previous infections that's what this is from eBstein bar lime covid that your body couldn't fully eliminate because of enk cell dysfunction now do you see how this gets married the inflammation amplifies eyes pain signaling activates micro ga in the brain and drives the systemic symptoms. That's the inflammatory issue. Now look at the insulin resistance. Most people think insulin resistance is just this metabolic thing. They think of it as something that only affects fat, glucose metabolism. That is so dead wrong. Even doctors will say this. They'll argue with me and I'm like, you're wrong. How does it feel to be wrong? Because you're wrong. Insulin resistance is actual multi-system catastrophic failure. Insulin signaling is or insulin is a signaling hormone. Okay, it affects mitochondrial function, inflammatory pathways and neurological health. So in fibromyalgia patients 100% of the time impaired glucose metabolism and mitochondrial utilization. Impaired mitochondrial utilization 24 exploration medicine did an entire review on this and proved this already. Their cells literally can't access the energy properly. This is very critical because pain processing is metabolically pricey. It's very expensive. So your phalamus, your prefrontal cortex, your spinal cord, all burning glucose to process sensory information. When insulin signaling breaks down, these regions become energy starved and the system tanks. That's insulin. That's the second thing. Now look at ATP shortage, the mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a result of inflammation and insulin. Right? So you see where the problem is. And they feed off each other. This is the silent killer. This one, mitochondrial dysfunction in fibromyalgia and CFS are well documented, by the way. Exploration Medicine 2024. There's so many research studies, but this is my favorite one. Patients have reduced ATP production, elevated lactate, elevated ROS, reactive oxygen species. So, think about what this means. ATP is literally the energy currency of every cell in your entire freaking body. Your neurons need it, immune cells need it, muscle cells need it, endothelial cells need it. So when you're in this massive ATP blackout, everything malfunctions. Your immune system can't regulate properly. Inflammation spirals. Your nervous system can't maintain all the pain gating that is required. So the pain signal goes through the roof and your muscles can't produce energy. So what do you think happens if you can't do that? You get tired. Not separate problems, one cascading failure across multi systems. This is exactly what I talked about on social media. So let me walk you through what's happening in the nervous system because this is where the pain originates. So in a normal brain pain is processed through a very sophisticated system actually you have ascending pathways no sceptors detect danger and send signals up the spinal cord to the brain. descending pathways. The brain processes this information, applies emotional and cognitive context, and then sends inhibitory signals back down the spinal cord saying, "Actually, you know what? We're cool. This isn't dangerous. Stop the pain." In fibromyalgia, both of these systems are broken. The ascending pathways into the brain, hyperactive. So, now you've got elevated substance P, elevated glutamate, NMDA receptor sensitization. 2024 PMC proved this. the pain signal is actually being amplified there. Remember what I said, the gain, right? So, it's turned up the volume, but at the same time, the descending inhibitory pathways are broken. Serotonin, norepinephrine, the neurotransmitters that they shut down pain are depleted. 2024 PMC proved this, and no doctors are talking about this, which pisses me off. The brake system doesn't work. To make it worse, you've got micro galactation in pain processing regions. Phalamus, lyic system, prefrontal cortex. Again, 2024 exploration medicine proved this. Micro ga are the brain's immune cells. When they activate, they release pro-inflammatory cytoines, IL6, TN, TNF alpha, which ampl just even worse. It's like pouring gasoline on a fire. They amplify the pain signaling. It's this horrible positive feedback loop that like watch pain drives inflammation. Inflammation drives pain round and round and round in this ever escalating cycle. And here's the part that just destroys me. Modern medicine looks at this and says the pain isn't real because there's just no tissue damage. But the pain is real. The neurochemistry is real. The inflammation is real. It's not just in tissue. It's in the neural processing of your damn biology. Look at this. Look at the gut brain cuz I talked about leaky gut. So, I may as well just address all these things that get affected by this. People don't realize just how profound the gut brain connection is in fibromyalgia. So let me explain the gut barrier one cell layer thick. It's an epithelial barrier maintained by tight junction proteins like clawins occludin in fibromyalgia patients. This barrier is compromised like 90% of the time. NIH 2024 you get increased intestinal permeability. It's called leaky gut folks. So when the barrier, the gut barrier breaks, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, LPS's cross from the intestinal lumen, the dirty nasty sewer system into the bloodstream. LPS binds to TLR4 receptors, unimmune cells and endothelial cells, triggering inflammatory cascades. Now you've got systemic endotoxmia driving this chronic inflammation. It gets worse. Additionally, the disbiotic microbiotic and fibromyalgia patients produce these altered shortchain fatty acids particularly reduced butrate production which is catastrophic. Here's why. 2024 exploration medicine. I need to explain butrate. This it feeds your colonoscytes and maintains the gut barrier drives regulatory tea cell development suppressing inflammation. Produces GABA in the gut which crosses the bloodb brain barrier and modulates what do you think? pain. So watch what happens. When butrate is low, the system fails. Get this. Most fibromyalgia patients also meet that criteria for IBS. Irritable bowel. So here's why. Because the same immune dysregulation affecting the pain processing pathways in the brain, also affecting the entic nervous system in your gut. When's the last time you heard about that? The gut microbiota disbiosis fuels the leaky gut, fuels the endotoxmia, fuels the systemic inflammation, fuels the micro gal activation, fuels central sensitization, and fuels pain amplification. It is one giant connected system that they're not looking at because they're too busy chasing symptoms. I don't want to chase your symptoms. In fact, I love you so much and I am so disgusted when people are in pain and that there's something that can be done about it. But I don't give a [ __ ] about your symptoms. I care about them never coming back. It's not the same. Look at the autonomic failure. A massive percentage of fibromyalgia patients also have POTS, postural orthostatic tacicardia syndrome. This is where the autonomic dysfunction becomes blindingly obvious. POTS is characterized, let me explain. It's by excessive heart rate increase greater than 30 beats per minute when you stand, right? Often with blood pooling and reduced cardiac output and fibromyalgia. Here, let's go over why this happens. The autonomic nervous system has two branches. Parasympathetic, rest and digest. sympathetic fight, flight or freeze. I know they've added that one and it's the truth because some people just stall out. So in fibromyalgia, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive chronically. So you've got elevated norepinephrine tone which drives alpha 1 adonergic receptor upregulation. 2024 PMC explained this entire thing. The blood vessels constrict too much. Sympathetic hyperactivity also impairs veagal tone. By the way, your parasympathetic brake pedal and it's not working. What did I say? The brakes are the accelerator's forward. The brakes the line is cut. They're broken. So when you stand up, normal physiology would activate the parasympathetic response because you have these barrel receptors in your neck allowing blood vessels to relax and blood to redistribute. But in POTS, if you POTS positive fibromyalgia patients, the sympathetic system just keeps on firing, baby. So the blood pools in your legs, your heart rate skyrockets to maintain cerebral profusion. Because if you guys don't know, if if nobody's ever told you this, the reason people pass out is because it's easier to pump blood this way than this way. So your brain is smarter than you. And it goes, your biology knows you better than you do. Your conscious is [ __ ] It'll lay you down and go, "No, we need to save your life." And it'll knock you down and solve the problem so it can pump blood to your brain easier. But this is why patients feel dizzy, lightheaded, and fatigued when they stand. Here's a crucial part. The sympathetic hyperactivity also amplifies pain signaling. It also drives inflammation. It impairs the HBA access connect dysfun or function. All connected. Yet again, look at the immune system. I got to address all this stuff because there's so many facets to fibromyalgia. It makes me crazy that they just go, "Oh, there's nothing wrong with your blood." I'm sorry that you guys have ever dealt with that. Like it I'm like I said, I've been a doctor a long time. I take labs are a snapshot of your body in at one second in time, but if I see consistency in labs, then I start to get really concerned. Or if I see a giant red flag, I get really concerned. Not if your fasting glucose is something after you just had a whopper with cheese. That's, you know, if I see elevated pancreatic enzymes, well, I'm going to be like, dude, you're stupid. You shouldn't have gotten your blood test right now. But if I see some red flags that cause that make me go, there's your problem. So, look, let's talk about what's happening with your immune system because this is where the picture becomes very complete. Fibromyalgia. This is trippy. This one's trippy. You have this paradox. Okay, paradox one. Watch. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytoines, but you have normal white cell counts. Paradox 2, reduced NK cell function, but patients aren't getting consistent like just non-stop infections. But there's more. Paradox 3, elevated IL6 and TNF alpha, but zero zero obvious. And autoimmune disease is a weird phrase because I just don't believe the body attacks itself. It is doing it as a reaction, but there's no obvious autoimmune disease. So, how do you resolve these three paradoxes? The answer is that fibromyalgia involves a shift in immune cell differentiation and activation patterns. Right? So you've got reduced te-c cell regulatory cells which normally follow me just let's stay with me please stay with me I know I go hard into this biology but I need you to understand this normally suppresses inflammation so when an immune response starts the problem you see where I'm going this it can't properly be regulated and it just keeps it's like the Energizer bunny right just keeps going and going so you've got impaired NK cell cytotoxicity which means infected cells cells with intracellular viruses or bacteria could be either or don't get cleared efficiently. They persist chronically activating what do you think? The immune system. So, they're constantly tapping that button. You've got mast cell activation. Mast cells line your mucous membranes and release something called histamine. They also release trypise and pro-inflammatory mediators when they get turned on. So, in fibromyalgia, especially response in a response to stress. Listen, that's why stress sets this off. That's also why I'll get into women, why primarily women and primarily when you are cyclical. You'll see whether it's pmenopause, postpartum, could be all of this stuff. Just follow me, okay? They're chronically degranulating. This drives local and systemic inflammation. As cell response is there for a reason. It's not there to be on all the time. Most of the cases, you've got circling auto antibodies against human against proteins involved in pain processing like antithetic anglia antibodies. You've got your immune system is literally attacking. Listen, it's this is why I'm saying these SGCs. It attacks your own pain processing neurons. What do you think's going to happen? That's I have a sunburn. It's causing me incredible pain. [clears throat] Let's go out in the sun. That's exactly what's happening. The inflammatory profile shows I promise. I promise I elevated IL8 and TNF alpha 100% and it shows reduced IL10 which is the anti-inflammatory cytoine. 2024 PMC proved this as well. Your immune system is stuck in this pro-inflammatory state and all of this inflammation drives micro gal activation in the brain which perpetuates central sensitization. This is why I'm trying to explain you have to understand all the systems. Here's something that should be obvious by now but nobody is talking about this at all. Fibromyalgia predominantly women strange. Why? Here I'll help you. The answer is in the hypothalamic pituitary gonatal axis the HPG axis and its interaction with the HPA axis. So 2024 they published that they showed that the study that proved fibromyalgia pathogenesis requires a very specific combination high HPA access activity stress combined with low HPG access activity so low estrogen progesterone relative to the patient's baseline this is important they show this in 2023 uh or sorry 2024 plus one here's the mechanism so you understand what's happening estrogen and progesterone regulate gabaurgic and glutamatergic balance in your brain. GABA is inhibitory. It calms things down. The easiest way to explain is glutamate excitatory. So when estrogen is high, you get more GABAurgic tone. When estrogen is low, you get this glutamaturgic dominance. Right? This is what's controlling the show. So during high stress periods, high HPA combined with low estrogen periods, follow me. This is why I was saying permenstrually, postpartum, pmenopause, even menopause, your brain gets stuck in this violently excitable state, the theamocortical loop, which is the system that processes all of your sensory information. It changes over into I'm pissed off. I hate everything. It's basically a pathology and it doesn't turn off. And here's what's even better. Reproductive hormones regulate immune function. So estrogen promotes regulatory te-c cell development and TH2 immune responses that's it's controlled right so this is more anti-inflammatory by the way progesterone also anti-inflammatory when these hormones drop when they tank you lose so imagine taking this just follow me on this imagine taking this menopause per menopause and you have some doctors saying you need to take an oral estrogen and rub some cream on your vagina and that's going to solve your problems that is a downstream effect of an upstream problem. So you're treating symptoms downstream, which is exactly why the stuff never goes away. So how about this? If you actually treated the problem and you solved the problem, follow me on this. Then when you stopped anything, the problem should be gone. Agreed? You guys have been indoctrinated to think that you have to take something for the rest of your life and that solves your problem. Then the problem is never solved. It's managed, which is exactly why they make so much money off of you and they're screwing up your biology and hurting people for profit. Pisses me right the hell off. So watch when these hormones when they go tits up you lose immune regulation and pro-inflammatory responses are what control the entire show. This is why you see fibromyalgia peak permenstrual postpartum pmenopause every single time the system is loaded with stress and it's like you're literally warming up the engine and then the spark that triggers you flooring it is a hormonal withdrawal. This is what bothers me. Here's what modern medicine does and prepare yourself because this is where the catastrophe becomes incredibly clear and honestly why I'm so angry right now. NSAIDes. I'll go through the common things they treat you with. They don't work. None of this stuff works and I'll show you why. They give you ibra aspirin, neproxin. Oh, talk about toxic. The idea is this. Reduce the inflammation, you'll reduce the pain. Okay, I get the logic. It's a it's a logic from a third grader trying to do biochemistry. It doesn't make any sense because here's why it fails. First, Nsaides block COX 1 and COX 2 enzymes. So, yeah, they reduce some prostaglandins, but prostaglandins aren't just pro-inflammatory. Oops. They're also necessary for gastric mucosal protection, renal function, and platelet aggregation. So, watch, here's what happens. Chronic cuz imagine, I get it. If you're in pain, you want to get get out of the pain. If you are constantly struggling, you want to stop the struggle. I understand that. and working out harder and eating cruciferous vegetables and taking black kohash or listening to someone that tells you all about slapping this patch on you that's going to solve all your problems is not going to solve it. But I get why people do it because they feel helpless and lost. I'm trying to take away that helpless and lost feeling and give you all the damn answers so you can just solve the problem. Watch what chronic NSAID use leads to. Gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, especially in people with leaky gut, which fibromyalgia patients pretty much all have. acute kidney injury, renal interstatial disease, increased cardiovascular problems, like oh, I don't know, heart attacks. You guys, are you nuts? Listen, here's the second part that you really, and this is more important about NSAIDs. We can go into the side effects and lay this down. There's no such thing as side effects. They're only effects, by the way. But NSAIDs don't address the root cause. They don't fix mitochondrial dysfunction. They don't restore NK cell function. They don't heal the gut barrier. In fact, they do the opposite. They're suppressing a symptom while the underlying disease just rages on, baby. Oh, let's keep on going. NSAIDes actually impair mitochondrial function by disrupting mitochondrial respiration. So many studies since 2015 have proven this. Like, we're talking thousands. You're literally making the ATP shortage worse while treating the pain, which makes the pain ultimately, you ready? Drum roll. Friaking worse. Look at the SSRIs cuz I know some of you guys selective serotonin reuptic inhibitors, right? So, they keep more stuff in the syninnapse, right? Certilline, peroxidine, fluoxidine. The logic is they use all these things. They're all the same thing. Fibromyalgia involves low serotonin. So, let's increase serotonin. Follow me. Follow me on this because this is vital. The problem is a little more subtle and a little more profound than just that. SSRIs work by blocking serotonin re-uptake. So, serotonin stays, like I said, in the syninnapse longer. Okay? So, yes, there's a couple of times where this will help lightly, but it doesn't address the root cause. Again, low serotonin. It doesn't restore serotonin production. It doesn't fix the HPA axis. It doesn't reduce the inflammation or restore mitochondrial function. So, make it make sense. Again, you are treating a symptom, not a cause. Here's the other part. SSRIs have some of the most gut punch smack in the face side effects you could ever imagine. Sexual dysfunction, 60% of the people. Listen, just so you know, my wife is insanely sexy. I love my wife and I love having sex with my wife. If I was muted, if I had anidonia or just didn't nothing worked, I would be so upset and it would take away some of the ways that we feel close to each other. Are you out of your mind? Yes, sex is important because that's how human beings feel close. It's just been put on social media is something people buy. Weight gain, metabolic dysfunction, by the way, is what SSRIs cause. Emotional blunting, which is anido. You don't feel joy, which is a terrible way to live. Just so you know. Suicidal ideiation, by the way, in young people. Comment 35%. There's something called discontinuation syndrome. Brutal, brutal withdrawal symptoms. And here's the thing, follow me on the biochemistry. If serotonin signaling is broken, follow me. If it's broken, not because you don't have enough serotonin, but because the serotonin neurons are damaged by inflammation and oxidative stress. If the serotonin receptors are disregulated, then increasing synaptic serotonin can't fix the problem. You're put a band-aid on something that is hemorrhaging out either side and going, I don't know why this doesn't work. Let's try the third one. Gabapentin, pregablin, both of these garbage. Neurontin L. Holy moly, this stuff. I see advertisements for this stuff on social media. I see it on my television. Makes me want to turn off my TV or throw rocks at it. Listen, they block calcium channels in the spinal cord to reduce pain signaling. Okay, so right off the bat, that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up because you're blocking something your body is trying to do thinking that it's going to make you better. So now this can provide relief, but this is a devastatingly blunt [ __ ] instrument because watch cognitive dysfunction. It's called they nickname it gabapentin brain. Dizziness, weight gain, dependence, massive withdrawal issues. Anyone that's been on GABA knows exactly what I'm talking about. More importantly, listen, this is what I was saying. You suppress pain signaling without addressing why the signaling is amplified in the first place. So you're not fixing inflammation, immune dysfunction, mitochondrial failure, HPA dysregulation. You're silencing the smoke detector, and going, "Let's just sit here and watch the house burn down anyway." All three of these treatments do the same freaking thing. They suppress symptoms without addressing the biology. In most cases, in fact, I'll just say this. I'll make a blanket statement. All of the cases, they make the underlying biological problem even worse. I'm trying to help you, man. Fibro Here's the insight. I'll give you this and I'll try and button this up as fast as I can because I I know you guys got things to do. But fibromyalgia is reversible because it's not a genetic disease and it's not a degenerative tissue damage. It's a functional disorder. There's no bone sticking out anywhere. Your neurons are fine. Listen to me. Your neurons are fine. Muscle fibers fine. Organs fine. What's broken is the signaling, the communication, the regulation, the the coordination is so signaling can be repaired. 2024 they proved this. NIH, Exploration Medicine, PMC, they showed when you address the underlying factors, when you address what's actually causing the problem, they've proven this, inflammation, immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, HPA, HBA access dysfunction, the pain gone, systemic reset 100% of the time. This is why lifestyle interventions actually faking work. Exercise restores mitochondrial function and reduces inflammation. Sleep fixes the autonomic nervous system and allows for all the cellular repair. And believe me, I'll talk about what your kangaroo should be doing. Stress reduction, calms the HPA axis, dietary changing, changes, remove the inflammatory foods, heal the gut barrier, reduce endotoxmia, and the systemic inflammation. But here's the problem. These interventions take time. We're talking months and months, and they require very consistent execution, which is hard when you're in chronic pain and fatigue. I get it. I'm not going through it, and I'm not trying to say I understand, but I see it. And I I believe you want to escape. I get it. I do. and you're like, I just want this to go away right now. Even if you get can get symptomatic relief. I understand. I do. And I hate hearing that because I wish there was a magic wand. There isn't. The magic wand is the fact that you want to prevent it in the first place. However, we're at this point. So now we need to cross that bridge and solve the problem. This is where things like peptides come in. So look, I will walk through hypothetical things for your kangaroo because if I tell you exactly how the problem is, I get censored because heaven forbid I can't tell the truth. Oh, I can't expose you to the truth. I can tell you the truth all day, which is what I'm doing, but people don't like it. So here we go. Cax, synthetic peptide from ACTropic hormone. What it does, and this isn't one, you better listen to all of this if you're going to listen to it. Don't start throwing things. If you go, I can only get two of the three. Can I do it? No. Absolutely not. That's like going, "Listen, I need four tires for my car, but I can only get three. Can I go run the race?" No. Can I go do the NASCAR? Can I start doing laps? No. You need all four. That's how you need to treat these because all and and for all of you Insta bro stealing my stuff going, I discovered this and I'm going to sell my product. [ __ ] off. bothers me because you're doing it because you want money and you're doing it because and you don't understand the biology. If your life depended on it, if someone held a gun to your head, you'd be like, I don't know, help people. That's why I'm here. So, if you're not going to do it all, don't bother. If you go, I can't afford all of it. I can only afford some of it. Save up the money and do it all. Borrow it from somebody. Put it on a credit card. I don't care where you buy it. I'm just telling you, do not do half-ass treatments because that's exactly why they don't work. So, listen. Emac activates melanoorton receptors, particularly MC4R. We're all over the brain and immune system. 10 NIH. So, here's what happens when you do this, just so you know. I guess I don't need to keep telling you about the research. There's enough of it out there. Here's what it does. It restores the HPA access function. So, the broken communication between your hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal gland starts working again. Your cortisol rhythms normalize, never mind getting out and getting some sun, by the way, every day, half hour in the morning. And if you go, "That's pretty hokey." Cool. Try it and then come back and talk to me because that stuff aggravates me. People go, "Oh, but I'd rather just take a pill." You can take all the pills you want. It's still not going to solve the problem. And by the way, first pass degradation destroys most medications anyway. And when they pegalate them to make them stay in your system longer, they cause even more. Or alpha alkalated 17. Holy crap, the damage. Your liver doesn't if you don't have it, you're dead. How about that? Okay, I know you make a new one every 150 days, but don't take a chance. Don't screw with your liver. So, here, second, CAX. By the way, these are all subq. If you take any of these oral, ball up your fist, punch yourself in the face, stop listening to that insta bro or insta expert or soccer mom that thinks she knows what she's talking about or the doctor shill that says, "My orals are different. They're liposal." No. No. I'm trying to give you the answer. I got nothing to gain here. Understand that. Look at the people and follow the money. That's it. Look, here's the second thing it does. Upregulates BDNF, brain derived neurotrphic factor and nerve growth factor in the brain. So, BDNF is, what do I always call it? Miracle grow baby for your brain, for your neurons. It promotes survival, growth, plasticity. Your damaged pain processing circuitry starts doing what it's supposed to do, what you're designed to do, which is healing. Third, it enhances dopamine and norepinephrine signaling in specific brain regions. This part's important. Don't miss this part. frontal cortex reward circuits, your mood improves, motivation comes back, cardiovascular regulation improves, which is relevant for POTS. It modulates is the fourth thing. It modulates immune function, reducing pro-inflammatory cytoine production, but it also enhances T-reg develop T- cell regs, right? The regulatory TE- cells. So essentially, here's what it does. CAX tells your hypothalus, hey man, listen, we're doing okay. You can come out of panic emergency mode. Look at M C. Okay, this is where things get really wicked. I'm not going to get into explaining it just so you understand. MSI is in the mitochondrial genome, but it acts as a hormone signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and a whole bunch of other tissues. By the 2015, Nature Medicine proved this. But here's what it does. Restores mitochondrial ATP production through AMPK activation and restoring restores the oxidative phosphorilation efficiency. Right? This is what they talked about in nature in 2015. Your cells get energy again so they can do what they're supposed to do. Just so you know, the energy currency, the fundamental currency that your entire body runs on is ATP. No magic other fairy dust that you have that some influencer is telling you about, it is ATP and ATP only. Pain processing, what did I say, is metabolically very expensive. It requires massive amounts of ATP. Immune function requires massive amounts of ATP. So when ATP returns, the system reboots. Then second, it improves insulin signaling through EMPK, helping to reverse the insulin resistance component of fibromyalgia. Then it suppresses the inflammatory pathways. But it does this while enhancing regulatory tea cell development. So your immune system starts normalizing again. Oh, this stuff's gangster. Fourth, it crosses the bloodb brain barrier and enhances neuronal mitochondrial activation. So it improves central energy metabolism and pain processing. So those micro ga don't go bananas anymore. Because here's what mc is literally telling your mitochondria, hey man, wake up. Let's start producing energy again. BPC157. This stuff's awesome. promotes tight junction protein expression collided oxidants z1 in intestinal epithelial cells 2010 they proved this this stuff BPC is like a staple part of my house it's everywhere and it pretty much goes into every single kangaroo protocol I ever have no matter what it is that good if I had to have one universal peptide BPC I wouldn't even think twice about it but your leaky gut heals the barrier that was letting all the lipopolyaccharides LPS's through now actually works again and when the gut barrier heals back they stop crossing now here's So what happens? Systemic endotoxmia just shuts down. Pro-inflamm pro-inflammatory cytoine production drops to near zero and BPC upregulates. Hgf hypatic growth factor and VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor. The blood brain barrier actually heals. Your vascular endothelium heals. Tissue profusion improves. And in POTS, watch blood pressure regulation improves. Just so you know, BPC-157 massive anti-inflammatory direct massive anti-inflammatory effects. So it reduces pro-inflammatory cytoine production, enhances nitric oxide signaling. Remember inos and ENOS and oh that's not we're not done yet. Look at this. It all You know what else it does? I'm just thinking things right now. It's awesome. Promotes nerve growth and neuroplasticity. GDNF, NGF upregulation. BPC is like handing your body's healing machinery. All the tools it actually needs and the best tools ever created and all the materials to actually do the frigin job. Wow, look at TB500. Okay, TB500 upregulates HSP70 which is heat shock proteins which function as they're like these like a molecular I'm thinking about my daughter going on a date, right? I'd be a chaperone. That's what this is. It's like a molecular chaperone for cellular protein repair and stress response which g all kinds of stress response when she went on her first date. So the damaged proteins get repaired and cellular stress decreases. Okay. It promotes angioenesis, which is formation of new blood vessels through VEGF, just like BPC, and a whole bunch of other pathways that I just don't really have the time to get into because now I'm starting to get hungry. Tissue ox, watch what happens, though. Tissue oxygenation improves, so you lose the hypoxic aspect. Pain processing improves with better oxygen delivery because your body runs on this weird thing called oxygen. It suppresses TGF beta signaling, which is the primary driver of pathological inflammation and fibrosis. So now the chronic inflammatory state unwinds. It suppresses pro-inflammatory cytoine production from immune cells. So now watch IL6, TNF alpha, IL8, they they go to almost zero. Promotes neural endthrow or outgrowth and neuroplasticity helping to reprogram the pain processing circuitry. So TB tells your body, the easiest way to explain it tells your body, you ready for this? This is complicated. Repair everything right now. KPV, by the way, this is one of the coolest anti-inflammatories on the planet. It does so much more than that. This is why understanding the mechanism of what a peptide does is so radically different than going, I see you guys in your posts, man, with your little white tile posts going, "Take this for this, take this for this, take this for this. That's why you're an imbecile." Cuz that's not how these work at all. Not even close. You're treating them exactly like people treat drugs wrong. They're signals. You guys aggravate me that are doing that. Makes me crazy. And if you get in my comments go, I don't like this guy cuz he's calling me out for being a piece of [ __ ] trying to milk people for all their money and lying about things. Yeah, because it bothers me. I'm here because I care. You're here because you want the money. I don't care if I have one follower on YouTube or I have millions. Your job, by the way, all of you guys listening to this should be to send millions and millions of people here and going, you better subscribe to this guy's channel. Like, I should have a 100red million subscribers to this channel. I don't care about the money. I care about the fact that 100 million people are getting better. But everybody goes out and goes, "I want to see a guy do donuts in a parking lot and smash into a kitten. You guys are sick and twisted. How about you just solve mankind's problems?" So look at KPV. Yes, it bugs me and I realize I deviate, but I'm doing this cuz I care. Like I want people to have such a great life and it's possible. I've been at the other on the other side of this, man. I've been on the other side of this equation, you guys. And if you've seen my story, it sucks. There's nothing about it that it made me so resilient. I I this one person that was in my group for a while and that said, "I'm a resiliency expert." No, you're not. Every time something gets hard, you fall apart and whine and cry. That doesn't make you resilient. Going through hell didn't make you resilient unless nobody knows you went through it. I don't care if you know my story or not, but I went through hell, but I don't use it. I don't even talk about it. I just go, "Listen, it didn't make me who I am. I did, and I listened to God, and God said, "You got a mission to do, so now here I am." Fair enough. I'm here to help. So, here's what KPV does. Regulatory T- cell development function. It cranks it up. Restores immune homeostasis. The broken regulatory system actually starts working again. It suppresses. Hold on. I don't think you can ever drink too much coffee. It's just so gangster. It If some of you guys know some really cool coffee, I like Invader coffee, by the way. My buddy Wes Wlock drink. He makes it. It's his company. It's really good. There's a shameless plug for Wes, huh? God, you think that kind of marketing you can't buy. It's so good. The directly suppresses pro-inflammatory cytoine production from macrofagages andic cells and te- cells. So, the inflammatory state starts to reverse. If anything, it completely turns off. It enhances barrier function both gut barrier and blood brain barrier does it through tight protein junction or tight protein upregulation. This, by the way, just so you know, watch. Remember what I said about BPC doing the same thing, right? Very synergistic. BPC and KPV in this aspect. It's not like you take them all at the same time. And KPV is not a maintenance peptide, by the way. PPV has massive anti-inflammatory effects in the gut specifically. Excuse me. So, it makes it particularly useful, I would say, right? If you understand where I'm going with this, for the gut dispiosis and leaky gut component of fibromyalgia. 2010 gastroenterenterology research by the way proved its efficacy is far superior than anything else to reduce gastrointestinal inflammation. Strange. How many of your doctors have told you about that? None. KPV crosses the bloodb brain barrier and modulates micro galactation. Remember the little immune kamicazi assassins that are attacking your own cells. So it reduces the neuroinflammation. 2010 neuroscience showed that KPV is telling your immune system, hey man, listen, why can't we just get along? Stop fighting yourself. Now here's the one that I wasn't going to touch this. There's a couple of more aspects here like that that I could talk about that I use with my protocol, but there's they involve some finesse. But alpha 7 nicotinic I was getting into it. Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on immune cells specifically macroofagages and te- cells. This is called the cononergic anti-inflammatory pathway 2010 nature immunology talked about this. Dr. Brian Artist is phenomenally intelligent with this stuff. I give him nothing but credit. This guy is the first one to bring it to light like he does and nobody knows it better than that guy. You want to pay attention to Brian. He's a good dude. He knows his stuff and I trust what he says. So look at let me explain. So first alpha 7 receptor activation on macroofagages is going to suppress TNF alpha I1 beta and IL6 production. It does this something called a stat 3 pathway inhibition. Proin pro-inflammatory cytoines gone. Alpha 7 activation promotes regulatory T- cell development and function immune. What do you think happens there? T-reg like T- cells like T- rag cells your immune regulation shows up and it starts doing its job again. Alpha 7 activation increas it knocks up or it enhances the veagal apherent signaling so it improves veagal tone parasympathetic function. So this is why I'm saying this remember what I said about POTS this helps POTS and autonomic function massively. Alpha 7 activation also upregulates and I can't say the word believe me I want to. I'm just going to keep calling it alpha 7 but you know what I'm saying. N I C O T I N. Right? So there we go. Upregulates BDNF in the brain. promotes neuroplasticity and repair. So, think of all these benefits and yet they're trying like they're trying to make sure that you can't get this. Do you know that 2030 you're not going to be able to get this anymore? So, my opinion would be I would stock the hell up and start growing my own, but that's just my opinion. I don't know if some sensor is going to lose their marbles when I say that, but that's okay. This will be on Rumble as well. It also reduces inflammatory and pain signaling on the spinal cord through alpha 7 receptor activation on the dorsal horn neurons. This is getting deep into neurology, so I guess I don't need to go that deep. Just understand this stuff is freaking amazing. I'm not talking about cigarettes, by the way. I'm not talking about pouches. I'm not talking about any of that. So, if you go, "Well, I'm going to take a pouch." None of that works. It is a patch or a soak. That's it. That's it. It's there's no other way to do it. If you go, "Well, I'm going to smoke. I'm going to take these Zen pouches." No, that's not that. None of that works. The bololis that it delivers is so massive. What it's doing is it's telling your vagus nerve and your immune system you need to activate the anti-inflammatory response. So all of this stuff doesn't work in isolation. You have to this is a very synergistic setup. And there's a couple more key components, but I just I'm running out of time and honestly I'm getting really hungry and a little bit loopy. They work synergistically attacking the three fundamental failures from every single possible side that you can and they do it in a way that actually reverses the damn problem. Right? You want to solve the mitochondria, solve the immune system, solve the barrier problem, solve the neuroendocrine aaxis, change the sensory processing system. And here's the beautiful part. When you use these all together in a very coordinated, put together protocol. You're not just suppressing symptoms. You're addressing every single underlying biological failure all at the same time. You're giving your body the damn tools and the resources and the one that everybody doesn't like the permission to actually do its job. Listen, fibromyalgia is not, I said this before, it's not a pain disease or psychological or all in your head, which really makes me angry. Even though the pain is processed in your head, it's still there. System failure. That's what fibromyalgia is. Inflammation, insulin resistance, ATP shortage. Three failures cascade through your immune system, your neuroendocrine system, your autonomic nervous system, your GI system, your vascular system, sensory processing system. I mean in virtually every system that you've got nervous system responds by amplifying pain signals and losing the it gets taken away the ability to inhibit them and your immune system responds by activating and staying activated. Mitochondria they produce less energy. Gut responds by becoming incredibly permeable and dumping endotoxins into your system. The endocrine system responds by completely disregulating and the reproductive system shifts hormone balance. So nothing works right. All of this is happening at the same time and all of this is very real biology. Modern medicine books piss me off because they say, "I don't see what you're describing in my standard blood work playbook." So, it's not real. That's not medicine. That's intellectual lazy. It's being an imbecile as a doctor. I don't care how many degrees are after your name. You're a twit because you're actually costing people their quality of life because you go, "It's not in my book. Your book is wrong." Who wrote the book, by the way? You ever look at that? Never mind the fact that we can go back into history and go, "History is written by the winners but not the truth tellers." That's a whole other conversation. Put on a tin foil hat. I don't care. Here, listen. You want to know? Here, I'll show you why what I do works. What I do is real doctoring. Look at the neurotransmitter systems, the inflammatory cytoine profile. I look at mitochondrial function, immune cell phenotype. I look at the HPA axis function. I look at micro gal activation. And I understand that fibromyalgia is a legitimate disease of neural processing, immune regulation, and cellular energy production. And here's the best part. Because I look at it this way, I have a real protocol for my kangaroo, Cax, Mottz, BPC, TB, KPV, NICO, TE, and a few more. But it's not magic, you guys. This is applied biology. You're look at here's what's happening. You're restoring mitochondrial function, suppressing pathological inflammation, healing the broken barriers. You're restoring immune regulation. You're promoting neuroplasticity and repair. You're basically doing a hard reset on your neuroendocrine system. You're giving your body everything it needs to do its damn job because you're already born with it. And here's the part that breaks my heart. We know this works. You want to know that? This is the part that really this breaks my heart. It pisses me off, too. I've seen this. I've seen full recovery with people, my clients, my patients. Full recovery, fibromyalgia, not improve, recover. Pain gone, fatigue resolved, cognition sharp, immune systems normal. But here's the issue. I can't talk about this at crazy volumes because it's not what you're using isn't approved by the FDA. Are you nuts? And if people are worried about insurance companies paying for it, are you out of your mind? So now people suffer? My job above all do no harm. That doesn't even make sense to me. Listen, people this is it bothers me so much. People take SSRIs that make them numb and impotent. Taking gabapentin that destroys their cognition. NSADes that destroy their kidneys and their gut or their life. Suffering through side effects while the underlying disease rages the hell on. How is that even Listen, the evidence is as binary as it gets. Here's what I want you to understand when you leave this cuz I do. I want to go eat. I said it yesterday. You're not broken or crazy or weak or anything else. You have a real disease caused by real biological failures. And the disease is reversible. It's not manageable. It's not suppressed. Reversible. Neurons heal. Immune cells normalize. Endocrine system can reset all day. Baby mitochondria can function again. Your barriers can all seal again. All of this stuff is how your body is designed. Otherwise, every time you cut yourself, you would never stop bleed. You don't have hemophilia. And even that is a whole other conversation I could get into. It's biology screams that it's possible. And the proof is irrefutable because we've seen it. That's why I come out here so you understand the mechanism deeply enough to actually pursue it and do something about it instead of walking into someone, what do I always say? Some doc jackass with a white coat and a god complex saying, "Don't listen to this guy. What you should do is take my pill instead so I can buy myself another jag." You need to think beyond what current modern medicine tells you. You can apply this or you can ignore it. You can share this. You can give me the finger. I don't care. But if you're going to go into my comments and start dropping thumbs down, whine about it because I didn't give you the answer fast enough or I'm leaving certain things out. I'm leaving certain things out because I can't say them here because free speech ain't free. But you have this. You can email. You can There's a million ways to get in touch and work with me. That's not what I'm saying. But I'm trying to give you the answers that at least you can do something about your own damn life. The science is there. The path is there. The results are there. All of this stuff works. You just have to step up and actually go, "All right, I'm going to do something uncomfortable. Have the courage to freaking walk it." That's all this is. Because fibromyalgia is same with chronic fatigue. 100% reversible. I know because I see it all the time. Anyway, I got to go.
