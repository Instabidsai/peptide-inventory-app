All right, so I just finished my Sunday webinar and it was fun. It was really great. And I got to give a shout out to this dude Todd, man. He uh he flat out said, "Really? It actually choked me up on the call. It's still going through my head." He said, "Colleon cancer." He said, "I saved his life." You guys don't really understand how deep this goes for me and why I come out here every day. I don't do it for any attention. I don't care. I do it so somebody gets an answer. It's that simple. So, I I I hope you guys really get that because I I don't do this for me. I have the knowledge. I'm just trying to give it to you guys. [ __ ] I'm out of water. I'm out of coffee. Man, this is it's like all kinds of nuts right now, huh? All right. So, here's the deal. One of you guys asked me a question and it was about menopause. Listen, menopause, I empathize because that's some rough times sometimes for people, for women, and I want to help. So, you need to actually listen to me instead of just going through the the hoops and listening to some doctor expert because listen, if you're a woman and you're the expert, great. If you're a man and you're the expert, great. But are you actually getting the results? I want you to have the results. And the the answer isn't the what you think it is. And this isn't some gimmick or some like, "Buy my stuff." Like I said, I always say this at the beginning, I don't care. You buy from Elite Biogenics, awesome. You don't, that's fine. I don't care. You want to join my black card. Go to Instagram, type in the word black card. Two words, one word. Get set up for both. It'll tell you exactly how to do it. No, it's not free. And on Instagram, it's 10 grand. It's 9,997. I'm transparent and it's worth every penny. It's for a year. And I only take wire now. I just take wire transfers. And I It's worth it. So, you got to do what you want to do. But how long have you been waiting to get an answer from your doctor? Yeah. How long you think you're going to wait to get an answer from this doctor? Yeah, exactly. Thought so. So might want to put that in into your thought process a little bit. But menopause the question was MOS C versus NAD+ and they're totally different, right? One is a co-enzyme, one is a peptide. So let me explain. Well, a signal, right? Mi is this mitochondrial derived signal. And I'll explain all this to you, but you got to understand this isn't about selling products. This isn't about getting you to do something that I want you to do. It's me telling you what's going to work so you have a better quality of life and you build a robust human being that actually lives the way you want to live. Like, I'm not here to be polite. I love you guys so much, but I'm not here to be polite or make you feel comfortable. I'm here to basically deliver an autopsy report every day on all the lies. In this case, this is a lie that's been sold to hundreds of millions of women for decades. And it's the lie called the big change, right? Listen, the word change just, you know, is so passive and so benign, like the freaking weather, like something that just happens to you. this natural transition. It's the single greatest piece of medical misdirection of the last century. It's not a change. It's not normalizing something like that is very aggravating to me. It is a systemic cascading destructive catastrophic failure. It is the control demolition of your body's most critical command and control center. And you need to start at ground zero of this entire failure, your ovaries. And stop right now, please, thinking of them as just some egg factory. My god, there's so much more than that. That's a grade school biology simplification. And it's kind of insulting to yourself. They're not factories. They're endocrine power plants. They're the central processing unit, the CPU for a hormonal network that governs everything from your cognitive function to your metabolic rate. And when this power plant begins its very slow, grinding, debilitating shutdown, the entire national grid of your body goes dark. Follow me on this. Estrogen, progesterone, testosterone. You hear sex hormones, a lot of you, and your mind goes to libido, to periods, but you're thinking too small. You're you're missing the scale of the catastrophe. These aren't just they're not just hormones. They're master regulatory molecules. They're the executive orders that keep your physiology running. So their decline is not just a suggestion. It's not. It's a declaration of war on your entire physiology, on the entire OS, the operating system. It's just listen, war is against you whether you like it or not. And I'm going to dissect the entire battlefield symptom by symptom at a cellular level so you actually understand what's going on. So let's go through the symptoms one by one. Symptom one, the hot flash. Medicine has a fancy term, basal motor instability. Sounds complex, right? Which is how medicine hides its ignorance. So, how about we be blunt? It's a neurological friaking glitch. It's a bug in the code. I'll explain even what it does. Your hypothalamus, it's your body's thermostat, and it's packed with estrogen receptors. Estrogen is the signal that says all systems normal. But when that signal tanks, when it plummets, the hypothalamus is flooded with noise. So, it misfires and it receives this corrupt data and decides your core temperature is just shy of the surface of the sun. It's like 170°. I realize the sun is hotter than that before somebody tries to correct me, but it triggers an emergency cooling protocol, dilates blood vessels, the flush, and makes you sweat. It's your thermostat that's having a panic attack. 2011 study in menopause journal used functional MRIs to show that during a hot flash, there is a very distinct measurable burst of activity in the brain stem and insula. These are the areas, just so you know, that govern thermal perception and autonomic response. It's not in your head. If somebody tells you it pisses me off, it's in your brain's wiring. Remember what I told you? It's a corrupt code and it's a it's there's a hardware problem that's going on. Symptom two, your sleep gets absolutely obliterated. You don't just have trouble sleeping. Your sleep architecture collapses. It's not some fancy language or poetic language. It's a technical term. Sleep has architecture. It really does. It's a deliberate structure of deep wave and light sleep, right? REM, deep wave, light. Estrogen and progesterone are the primary modulators of something called GABA, which is your brain's chief inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA is it's the brake pedal. It's the one on the left, right? Without these hormones, your brain is all accelerated. It's all gas, no brakes. You're stuck in shallow, very fragmented, crappy sleep. 2017 paper current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes and obesity detailed very explicitly how the decline of these hormones directly disrupts the gabberurgic system leading to sleep latency, decreased sleep efficiency, pretty much disastrous sleep. So you wake up more exhausted than we went to bed because you haven't been through the restorative sleep cycles that are supposed to be happening. It's not a bad night, it's a structural failure. Symptom three, oh, I'm just getting warmed up, baby. Metabolic sabotage. The scale moves and it refuses to come back. This is where you find the core infection. Your resting metabolic rate doesn't just slow, it plummets off the cliff into the depths of whatever it is is below it. Why? Because of a sinister estrogen-driven fat migration. Watch. As estrogen drops, your body shifts fat storage from subq subcutaneous the relatively benign stuff that's under your skin and your hips and your thighs to visceral fat. This is the dangerous stuff. This is the fat that wraps your intestines, your heart, your liver, your kidneys, your organs. Don't think of this fat as some innocent storage because it's not. Visceral fat is an endocrine organ. An aggressive inflammatory pissed-off endocrine organ. It pumps out this constant stream of cytoines. What do you think? I say them all the time. TNF alpha IL6. But it also dumps out free fatty acids that travel directly to the li liver via the portal vein. So these molecules act like, it's my favorite, a wrecking ball on your insulin signaling pathway. So your muscle and liver cells, insulin receptors become very resistant. They stop listening. They just tune you up. They Helen Kelly, you're right there on the spot. Glucose piles up in the bloodstream. Don't get offended. I'm just using it as an example. Gluc and I realize she was deaf. I'm blind. But stop it. Glucose piles up in the bloodstream. So your pancreas in a state of absolute panic secretes more and more insulin. That's not good. This creates a state of hyperinsulinemia. So now high insulin has one primal non-negotiable command. Store fat. That's all it's there to do. It actively blocks lipolysis, which is the breakdown of fat for energy. So you're metabolically locked in your own prison. You're on permanent storage mode. 2005 New England Journal of Medicine showed very clearly that post-menopausal women have a significantly higher prevalence of insulin resistance independent of age related factors. completely directly linking the hormonal shift to metabolic dysfunction. Oh, but it goes a lot deeper. Let's have some fun. The entire metabolic catastrophe creates the root cause of everything. Fatigue. You need to remember those two words, please. Your mitochondria. Say it with me. Mitochondria. Yeah. These are the power plants inside every single one of your trillions of cells of 30 trillion cells. The little city that you're walking around with in this state of insulin resistance. They're drowning. They're drowning in a sea of glucose that they can't properly process and inflammatory signals that damage their machinery. The equipment's getting trashed. So, they become inefficient and sluggish. They produce less ATP, adenazine triphosphate, which is the fundamental currency for cellular energy. This is the what funds, I say it all the time, everything you're doing, including listening to this podcast. And instead, they leak reactive oxygen species, ROSS. They disastrous. They become factories of oxidative stress. This mitochondrial dysfunction is the final com. This is why I need you to get this between the MOSI and the NAD+. This is why it's so important. This is the mito this mitochondrial train wreck that's going on is the common pathway. It's the physiological reason for the brain fog, the muscle weakness, the crushing fatigue that feels like a lead blanket's on you 24/7. Your cells are literally biochemically tired. They're exhausted. It's not a hormone problem. Absolutely. I got nothing against HRT, but listen, it's missing so many things. Conventional medicine's answer is hormone replacement therapy, HRT. The medical establishment's brilliant nuanced solution. The buckets are leaking. So, they try and backfill them. This is a management strategy, a paliotative measure. It's the equivalent of hearing this horrifying metallic grinding disastrous sound from your car's engine and you just cranking up the stereo to drown it out. You're not fixing the engine. You're accepting the breakdown and you're trying to make the noise just a little more tolerable. How is that life? You're treating a hormone deficiency. I'm telling you the problem is not the deficiency. It's not. The problem is the cellular environment that the hormones are supposed to function in. It's the ecosystem. You're pouring high octane fuel into a rusted out engine with a bunch of seized pistons. It's not going to run. It's not. The root cause is cellular fatigue. The root cause is the insulin resistance. If listen and like I said HRT before you guys get in my comments and lose your minds yes about 50 to 60% of the time it's required so I'm not telling you that but that's one lever on something that require and it's a it's like a 20% lever you're missing the whole point and when they're doing that that's why so many people are on some patch or some injection or taken they're self-medicating and it's not working because you're missing the problem the cellular energy issue. So if HRT is, follow me. If HRT is just turning out the radio, what does fixing the engine actually look like? It doesn't look like a hormone. It looks like a damn engineer that comes in and solve the problem. Meet M C mitochondrial derived peptide. Notice the name. It's not a hormone. It is a peptide. It is a short chain of amino acids. It's encoded within your very own mitochondrial DNA. It's nothing new. It's speaking the same Latin that your body speaks. Your biology speaks this already. Think of it as a tiny encrypted little instruction manual for cellular repair. that with age and metabolic stress gets lost and forgotten and buried under the debris of a failing system which you've got right now if you got pmenopause, menopause, premenopause, all the menopauses. Here is its singular elegant function. And by the way, it's detailed like in a seminal 2015 paper in cell metabolism. Watch M. This is fact-based stuff. M C is primarily expressed in response to metabolic stress. Precisely the kind of stress we see in menopausal metabolic dysfunction. Weird. Its job is to forcibly reprogram your metabolism back to youthful insulin sensitive states. It does this by hijacking something called the AMK pathway. Oh, and believe me, it does it very well. AMPK, AM activated protein kynise. Now, you know what it is. It's this is not a minor player. This is the master regulator of all cellular energy homeostasis. It's the CEO of your entire metabolism. So when MC flips the AMPK switch, it issues a series of completely non-negotiable executive orders to the cell. Glucose transporters, it screams, to the cell membrane. Go there right now and seize the circulating glucose and shove it the hell into skeletal muscles for fuel. That's what it does. Really, I'm not kidding. It does this via the AMPK mediated transllocation of glute 4 receptors. If you really need to know lipolysis, it screams that too. Initiate, break down the stored triglycerides, unlock the fat stores, right? EMPK phosphorolates and inhibits acetal COA caroxilates. It reduces melaninal COA, which is a key inhibitor of fat oxidation. None of this stuff matters. I'm just trying to get you guys to understand what it like. The fancy biochemistry doesn't make a difference. Biogenesis, mitochondria, yells that, too. Replicate more, more, more. We need more power plants. Commence mitochondrial biogenesis. It freaks out. activation of PGC1 alpha if you have and then the last thing it does is it kicks in cleanup crews. It says come on wonder twins activate cleanup crews. Clear out the damaged proteins and all the organels. Autophagy right now. Those are the commands. Just let that land for a second. When in understanding how menopause works following this podcast, it bypasses the broken insulin signal entirely and it doesn't plead with any resistant insulin receptor. It goes over its head directly to the cellular machinery and forces it to work with youthful exuberance and efficiency. The same, by the way, that same 2015 study showed that administering M C to mice completely reversed with the same symptomatology as menopause completely reversed their obesity and insulin resistance. It didn't manage it, it cured it. It is the engineer that repairs the engine and reprograms the friaking computer. The difference is fundamental, right? Watch between NAD+ and MO C. You give a starving man a fish and that's the precursor like NAD+. It's a temporary fuel source. Teaching him how to fish. That's M C baby. Permanent recalibration of the entire system. So watch, let me let me connect the dots to the failure point. So you get this. Run the differential the DDX, right? Differential diagnosis. How does the engineer fix the five system failures? Metabolism. I'm going to go through all these one by one so you actually understand because I'm trying to link this together before I go inside because I really want to hang out with my wife. So this is why I'm speaking incredibly fast and banging out information as fast as possible. It directly assaults the insulin resistance. So by activating the EMPK, it forces skeletal muscles to uptake glucose, right? So it breaks that vicious cycle of hyperinsulinemia and visceral fat accumulation so you don't ball up your organs. It shifts the body's entire metabolic posture from storage to energy burning. By the way, this is a permanent reccalibration. It's not temporary. Neurology. The brain is a metabolic hog. I talk about this a lot. Consumes about 20% of your body's energy. So, by fixing the systemic metabolic health and crucially by improving mitochondrial function within the neurons themselves, MOT C guarantees that your brain has this clean efficient ATP that it requires, it demands to fire optimally. It by the way it also reduces neuroinflammation driven by those systemic cytoines TNF alpha right IL6 IL1 beta all of them. 2019 Redux Biology even showed that mod C has direct neuroprotective effects helping to shield neurons from oxidative stress. Sign me up and I'm a dude and I want to do this. How about the sleep? Remember I said sleep has architecture. So by stabilizing blood glucose levels and reducing the systematic or the systemic inflammatory load, MSI removes two of the primary metabolic stressors that shatter your sleep. Does more though, by the way, by optimizing mitochondrial function in the supermic nucleus, the brain's master clock. By the way, it supports the robust natural circadian rhythms necessary for deep restorative required sleep. You guys running on no sleep, it's not healthy for you. I don't care how much sleep you get as long as it's the right amount for your body to repair itself. Libido. This is the one I get so many questions from you women about this. How do I solve my libido problem? I get it. I get it. So, let me help you. This is the master stroke. Libido is fundamentally about energy availability. If your cells are fatigued, you have no energy for desire. Mod C works on a deeper level. Watch. By crushing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, it imp it improves vascular endothelial function. the health of the lining of your blood vessels. You have a bunch of blood vessels down in your plumbing, by the way. This is critical se for sexual response. Vital. It optimizes the hormonal environment for your adrenal glands and any remaining or ovarian stromal tissue to produce what little testosterone and DHEA they still can. And it does it allows it to do that more effectively, which is why this works in conjunction with HRT. But if you're just on HRT, this is where you're screwing up. It fixes the soil, which allows the remaining seeds to grow or the seeds that you're planting. HRT. You can't just have one. But what do they do? They just bomb you with a different patch, give you a different name, shove a different drug in your butt, whatever it is. None of this is going to help you until you've solved the cellular energy problem. Matsi doesn't treat symptoms. It reclaims the cellular youth that you're supposed to have. It directly counteracts the hallmarks of aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, altered intercellular communication, loss of proteasis. here. It tells an old, tired, busted ass cell to behave like a young, vibrant, destructible, youthful cell. And the inevitable question, does it boost estrogen? I'm going to get this from everybody. No. And that's the very cure of its genius. It doesn't provide any hormonal crutch that your body is going to become dependent on. It fixes the cellular ecosystem, the environment. It optimizes the internal terrain, the soil, so that every hormone producing gland you have left can achieve its own robust natural homeostatic balance. Again, it also allows any exogenous tes testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, whatever you're taking to operate at capacity, not at 20%. It supports the system instead of overriding it. That's why this is a marriage. Listen, I I want you guys to win. But the old paradigm is broken. It's busted like some old truck sitting in a farmer's field. It's not working. It's a paradigm of deficit management. Manage decline all the time. Hormones are low, so we add hormones. But the medical industrial complex has never asked the once never once asked the critical question. Why is the system failing? The problem was never just the lack of hormones. You guys, the problem was always the broken, fatigued, insulin resistant cellular engine that those hormones are supposed to run. Does that do you get this? HRT turns up the radio. M C fixes the damn engine. For 50 years, you guys, women have been told to accept the breakdown, manage the decline, to make peace with the grinding sound of the car and the motor breaking. That era is done. I'm burning this all down, baby. The science has moved the hell on. The question isn't how do I manage my symptoms? It's not. The question is, do you want to manage your decline or you want to engineer some kind of a revival so your system actually does its job? Again, I'm not dogging on HRT before some crazy lib woman goes bananas in my comments arguing with me or yelling at me. I'm actually giving answers. You do know why I come out here, right? Because I want you to win. How many times have I pitched go buy my stuff? Buy my new book. I'm going to be here. Like, I don't care. You want to join the black card membership? Awesome. I say it every time. You want to buy from Elite? Awesome. Nobody does it better. But I also don't care. I'm still coming out here. I'm still giving you the answers. So, I hope you guys got something out of this and this actually made sense. I'm going to go hang out with my wife. Why? Cuz she's sexy as hell. I love her. I miss her and she's my best friend. I got to go.
