Okay, you guys, I love the questions. I do. Keep them coming. Keep them coming. You guys asked me if I could do a little bit of a deeper dive on SS31. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go from A to Z on exactly what it does and why it does what it does. And a lot of the things that you guys don't know that it it affects in ways that it doesn't just repair damage, it makes cells younger. And I'll explain that in a way that that makes sense. How many of you guys are tired today? By the way, I ate I think my body weight yesterday at Thanksgiving and we don't do turkey anymore because personally I would rather have a tomahawk steaks or fillet or crab or lobster or whatever. I cheeseburgers. I don't really care. Whatever. It doesn't matter what you eat. It matters why you're doing it and hanging out with the family and the people that you love and care about. But I ate so much. I had a bunch of you guys ask me what we had for Thanksgiving. I don't know. It's a social media is a weird place. Like I said, I'm 52. I never took pictures of my food and sent it to my friends. It's just a different world we live in. But maybe I'll post what I we ate for Thanksgiving. But I feel it today. Even the sugar, right? Like my joints, right? They feel I feel it in my joints, my wrists. I was doing I did I about a was 165 to be exact. Lunges, suitcase lunges, either a 53 or a 70 depending on where I was in the rep scheme. a kettle bell single side right back and forth along with a bunch of pull-ups and some other stuff that I did today. Some running and a dyine, etc. But man, I felt those lunges in my knees today instantly. But think about it, that's how sugar affects you. Just that's not what this is about, but just so you know. So listen, Ess let me touch on a couple of things first because you're being taught now. I look at the things that I'm seeing on social media and in the medical world. The medical world's a lie. You go to Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Mexico, Panama, anywhere, anywhere, North America, and you get treatments that actually help you. Think about what I let that land. You get treat and you know what they're teaching you? Of course, the indoctrination. Yeah. You got to watch out though. They're not regulated. You don't know what they're pumping into you. What are they going to give you? Oh my god. What if it's some crazy? Then why do people go to other countries who have the money to go to a clinic to get repaired, to get healed, to get care, and come back and everything is gone. They're fine. There's a stem cell clinic in Tijana. It's the official stem cell clinic of the UFC actually. And these guys are knocking out all kinds of successful things. And to me, that matters. This is a person that actually gives a crap about a human being and their life and the results, not people that go, I did 10,000 stem cells and it didn't work for me. Number one, what kind of stem cells did you get? Yes, there are different kinds. And number were they clean? Were they disease-ridden? Do they have a memory? There's so many things. And the other part is stem cells are fantastic. Remember, when a stem cell is injected, by the way, that's instantly when you lose control of the stem cell. That's not a bad thing. I'm just saying it's not a don't come. I have people go, "What's better? Stem cells are a peptide." They're not the same. That's like saying, "What's better? my 2500 diesel or my 911 Turbo S. It depends on the circumstances. I'm not going off-road in the Porsche. I'm actually not going off-road in the diesel either. But if I need to pull the thing would sink like a rock, I'd need a definitely a 1500 or something smaller than that and lighter with a gas engine. Definitely not a diesel cuz those things are tanks. But if I needed to pull something heavy or drag something around or it just felt like rolling coal, I'm not going to do it my Porsche. But the reason I'm saying it is because circumstances dictate what's required and we're taught that what's required is going to dictate the circumstances. That's not the right way of looking at healthcare at all. And you guys are being lied to up, down, and sideways. And I'm not saying run out of the country to get stuff. Just make sure who which even if you are, you should. If there is better care elsewhere, what are you doing here? You're so afraid to go somewhere else because you're afraid of how they're going to treat you. What they're going to do is treat you as a human being, not as a product or a money machine where they can manage your decline. And that matters. Why do you think they're gunning for peptides all the time? Why do you think they're gunning for things like here I have to hold it up because they clip my video all the time. Right? This thing right here that I'm holding in my hand, this little patch. Why do you think they're gunning for that? Why do you think by 2030 commercial commercially available this is going to be non-existent? If you're born in 2009 or later, you will never see it on a shelf. Stock up. That's all I'm going to say. Get seeds, get leaves, patches, mints, lozenes. I don't know. Whatever it is, you can get it all. But the reason I'm telling you this is you're being fed a lie. And they're it's the genetic testing. Dude, I saw First of all, listen, Rea, if you ever see this, I'll wait till this focuses. I have to wait there. If you ever see this, you're a snake oil salesman. You're a con man snake oil sack of [ __ ] because you're selling peptide patches. Get the hell out of here. You are ripping people off for pseudocience, bro science, instab bros, using your manufactured credibility. Dude, I would get you on stage. I would rip you apart scientifically all day. I don't care who you think you are. That aggravates me so bad. Peptide patches. That doesn't even make sense. According bio, you it can't transermal. Yeah. Show me that it works. It's all it's saying. Show me the blood work. I'll choose the test subjects. By the way, I'll just buy You know what? I could do this. I could just demolish it. I'll just buy all the patches. How many you guys want to see me do that? I got the money. I could do it. And I have definitely the audience to do it. I'll just buy a hundred patches. I'll just do a small little study. Me, I'll I'll call Lane. All right. Bin. He's smart dude, man. he loves research. We'll carve out a research study and go, "Show me the blood work." You'll never see it with a patch. You'll never see it with oral, ever. And I'll make sure that they're not doctorred or paid for by some pharmaceutical company. 70%. That's what I said yesterday, right? 70% of all research is funded by pharmaceutical companies. Anyway, before I go off on a tangent because I tend to do that. Hey, if you know me, you know my tangents. You guys are told to fear your genes, right? You guys like genes. Ge nees. You You guys are taught, right? They're teaching you to feel your genetics, to fear it, rather. They're wrong, man. That's ridiculous. You can't. And I see it all the time. That's why I'm saying genetic testing. Get all this. You get all these genetic tests. I have this gene. I have that gene. What are you nuts? We have populated this planet. 9 billion plus people. Man, your genes aren't a problem. You've been enrolled in this lifong subscription service for a disease you might not need. Like the entire medical industrial complex, this 7, listen to this number. 3.7 trillion trillion dollar a year industry. You think they care here? Here. They're getting people in other countries. Not doing it here. It's built here. It's built on one simple terrifying premise that your body is fundamentally broken all the time and that disease is your default state and that your DNA is just sub. It's like ticking time bomb. You're just going to go. That's the most profitable lie ever sold to all of you. So, I'm just going to keep dissecting it every day. I'm going to come out here and I'm going to show you everything that happens and I'll teach you everything I got so you guys can walk around and have the same knowledge that I do. I don't want to have all the knowledge that you don't. I'm going to teach you everything so you know it. Then just you go out and make educated decisions. It's what I did. Three biological failures, right? The root of every single major chronic disease on the planet. And I'm going to give you the master key to fix them, too, by the way, on this podcast. It's this key is so powerful, so mechanistic. It doesn't just treat symptoms, it rebuilds the entire freaking engine. Start with the engine room, okay? Just look at the engine room of your physiology, the mitochondria. You have to understand this before I go over SS31, otherwise it's not going to make any sense. These aren't just cellular power plants. there. I said this on my post yesterday and it's so fundamentally wrong when they told you that in biology in the ninth grade, right? It's the power plant. There's it's so much more than that. It's the command and control center for your entire life. You have 40 quadrillion of them. Yeah, it's a big number. Their sole job is to take the oxygen that you breathe and the food that you eat and transform it into usable energy. ATP, right? Adenazine triphosphate. That's it. It's currency of life. The end. I there's no explanation that's needed on that. But that currency gets debased, right? The mint breaks down in the inner, which is the inner mitochondrial membrane. It's a delicate double layered structure that's just teeming with protein complexes. It gets damaged. That's your mint. Imagine the most sophisticated here, this is the easiest way to explain it. The most sophisticated semiconductor chip on the planet ever made. Just this crazy like it it makes Ultron from Avengers look like he's just simple, right? And then you pour acid on it. That's oxidative stress. That's modern life. That's the easiest way to look at this, right? The damage has a name. It's called mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Yeah, I know it's a bunch of fancy stuff. Remember it. It's the moment that the factory goes tits up, goes bankrupt. When that pore opens, the proton gradient, the very electrical potential that drives that ATP turbine collapses, ATP synthes, right? cytochrome C which is a protein that's essential for electron for the etc to function the electron transport chain to function leaks out into the cytoplasm and you know what cytochrome C is outside its proper environment nobody it's an executioner it's the trigger for programmed cell death apoptosis nobody's going to teach you that nobody's going to show you that and I will listen this is where SS31 comes in it's not a drug it's this four amino acid mechanic it's this targeted positive charge that is irresistibly drawn towards the negative charge of the damaged inner mitochondrial membrane. It doesn't waste time anywhere else. It doesn't go anywhere else. It just goes straight, it runs full throttle straight into the fire. And its primary target is something called cardioipin. This is a unique phosphoipid that's found almost exclusively in the inner mitochondrial membrane. And it's not just structural, it's functional. It anchors protein complexes of the etc complexes 1, three and four holding them in the perfect configuration for efficient energy transfer. But when ROS reactive oxygen species attack cardipin gets oxidized and it becomes a traitor and it releases cytochrome C. This is the problem. What did I say? It becomes executioner turn. It causes apoptosis. So SS31 binds to cardiolippin with an affinity that borders on being psychotically obsessed and it shields it and it prevents any oxidation. It does this by stabil so watch by stabilizing cardipin SS31 prevents the entire cascade of failure. The pore doesn't open cytochrome C stays put the proton gradient remains intact and ATP synth synthes ATP turbines keep spinning. You keep creating what? Adenazine triphosphate. Now listen, what does this microscopic repair job have to do with the diseases that terrify everybody that they're selling you on that you see all over the internet and all over television? Everything. Pathology flows from three biological failures only. They are the unholy trinity of 100% of modern diseases. And people will argue, they'll get on my comments. It doesn't matter. You're still wrong and I'm still right. systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ATP shortage. So, how about we just autopsy the entire thing? The first one is, and I'm going to do this every time because I want you guys to understand this. Systemic inflammation. This is the first one. When mitochondria are damaged, they don't just fail quietly. They become screaming beacons of distress. They release mitochondrial DNA fragments and formal peptides into the cytoplasm. They're mo they're molecules that are known as damps, right? these damage associated molecular patterns then these damps are recognized by the NLRP3 inflammosome. If you remember me talking about this and activate so here activating the NLRP3 is like pulling the fire alarm for the entire immune system of your body. It triggers the massive cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytoines. This isn't acute inflammation to heal a cut on your hand or a sprain or anything like that. This is the problem. This is the chronic low-grade bodywide siege that damages tissues, endothelium, and all of your organs. Not some, all of them. It's the constant background static of disease. That's just failure one. How about failure two? Insulin resistance. You guys, this isn't about eating too much sugar. It's about a broken energy metabolism. It's a crippled mitochondrion that can't efficiently process pyuvate through the TCA cycle, the KB cycle, right? This leads to a backlog of metabolic intermediates citrate, acetal COA etc. These molecules activate this family of enzymes called protein kynac PKC which in turn phosphorolates the insulin receptor substrate on specific serarine residues not tyroine. So there's a problem with this because the single this this little switch this is why it's a bad a big deal blocks the signal. So now this is what happens now. Insulin knocks on the door, but the cell can't hear. It's deaf. Remember, you go insulin deaf. And so, what do they do? They turn up the insulin, but that doesn't change the hearing. You follow me now? The glucose still stays in the bloodstream. This is insulin resistance. It's not a behavior. It's a biochemical consequence of broken mitochondria. That's failure two. And failure three is the energy bankruptcy. It's that ATP shortage problem. So, watch. With a compromised ETC, electron transport chain, the proton motive force weakens. Imagine it's like this and now it's like this. It's like at 2° instead of 30. The ATP synthesize enzyme slows down. The ATP ADP ratio, adenazine triphosphate, adenazine diphosphate ratio plummets. This energy crisis is sensed by the enzyme AMPK which we know M C is what stimulates, right? But the AM activated protein kynise is the master regulator of cellular starvation. But listen, here's the problem. It shuts down non-essential processes. So it impairs cellular repair, impairs protein synthesis. It even impairs autophagy. The cell exists in a state of austerity like it can't perform its basic functions at all. It's just surviving and barely. So it's not thriving and there is a difference because it can't do the things to maintain its at capacity, right? It's maintaining at 10%. These three failures are interconnected, synergistic, and they create the perfect pathological storm for your physiology. They're the common soil in which every single disease grows. Everyone 100%. Just apply it. Watch. Go from theoretical to the terrifyingly specific. And I will go line by line so you understand this. Because if you don't understand this, you're not going to understand really. You're just going to look at SS31 and go, "Well, I just want to take it because I think my mitochondria should be healthy." But that doesn't make any sense. That's like taking a preventative aspirin. So bleeding glutathione in your liver and going, "It's okay." Are you out of your mind? They've got you all convinced that you should take a baby aspirin every day. I want you to think about that. Would you take a cyanide drip every day if they told you it was going to help you? Absolutely frigin not. But some of you guys line up and go, "The FDA said it's okay, so I guess I got to do it." And then you just go and take these stupid drugs and you take all these medications thinking they're making you healthier. And yet you can't figure out why you're on nine medications and 10 years prior you were on zero. None. You guys, you're not sick because of a lack of aspirin or a lack of chemotherapeutic drugs or a lack of hum or a lack of or ace. don't have Alzheimer's or dementia or Parkinson's because of a lack of specifically because of a lack of L-dopa. You don't. You have to fix the problem that's causing it. You guys are getting treated for symptoms and you're just scooping it up like it's your favorite ice cream. Look at Alzheimer's disease. For 30 years, they sold you the amaloid hypothesis. It's a great freaking story. It's also bankrupt. The real It's a lie. The The real pathology Oh, this makes me mad. The real pathology begins decades earlier with a silent progressive energy famine in the hippocampus. If you look at FDGP PET scans, it shows, holy [ __ ] this is such a big number. 30 to 40% reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism in presymptomatic individuals. Holy crap, that's such a watch. Go have 40% of your bank account just gone. Go look at your bank account. Just be like, "Hey, I had a million in there and now I only have 600,000." You'll freak out. But you guys just go ahead and you do that with your neurological capacity. Cerebral glucose metabolism gone by 40%. They'll never teach you this stuff in school. Neurons are among the most metabolically active cells in the entire body. Without sufficient ATP, the sodium potassium pumps fail. Neuronal membranes depolarize. So now watch this aarent deolarization activates a secretase enzyme called base one. Now base 1's job beta site a cleaving enzyme 1. base 1's job is cuz you guys are going to ask its job is to cleave the amaloid precursor protein AP amaloid precursor protein. Now watch in this is all normal but here's the problem is when you don't have an energy-rich state. So in an energy rich state this is a very regulated process. In an energy starred state it becomes pathological. It produces toxic beta amaloid fragments. Huh interesting toxic beta amalloid fragments. And what do they tell you? The amaloid hypothesis. Exactly what I talked about in the beginning. The plaques are the tombstones, not the cause. SS-s31 addresses the cause. Watch. 2022 study in nature aging demonstrated 100% that SS31 administration in Alzheimer's restored cortical ATP levels. This is going to blow your mind. By 50% 50% in 8 weeks and reseduced amaloid beta plaque burden by over 60 frigin percent. By preventing the metabolic dysfunction that drives its production. It's I want to look at all the doctors that go, I'm going to give you all these treatments for this for amalloid plaque and towangle problems and go where were you on this one [ __ ] They're not treating you for what the they're not treating you for the problem. It's very frustrating to me as a doctor and as a human being. That's why I come out here cuz I actually adore mankind even some of you numb skulls that just can't get it through your head that what I'm telling you is the truth. Look at Parkinson's disease. The dopamineergic neurons in the substantia niagra pars compacta specifically have the very unique fatal flaw. They are incredibly complex. Ask any neurologist, they're going to be like, "Oh god, they're so complex." They're massively largely unminated. By the way, axons require enormous amounts of energy to maintain. That makes them exquisitly vulnerable to complex one deficiency. So, when complex one of the ETC fails the electron transport chain, it leads to a very specific type of oxidative stress that oxidizes dopamine itself, creating toxic quinone species that accelerate the death of that very neuron. This isn't random. This isn't random at all. This is a very predictable failure of high demand system. SS-s31 stabilization of the ETC directly addresses this this thing right here. If you there's a journal, the journal of neuroscience showed SS31 treatment improved complex one function 43%. And reduced the loss of dopamineergic neurons by the way by 75% in a neurotoxin model of Parkinson's effectively halting the damn disease progression when administered early enough. When they go, "You have early onset Parkinson's SS31." Not even a question. You think that's the first line of defense? Nope. Here's your L-dopa. Makes me mad. Like I told you, I don't know Michael J. Fox at all, but I breaks my heart. Makes me mad. Put me in front of the guy. I'll bleed to make sure he's okay. You know what his doctors are doing? None of that. You know why? Look at him. He'd be better if they were. Screaming louder to something that can't hear you doesn't change the fact that still can't hear you. It's like trying to speak a language to somebody. They don't understand the language and you slow it down and get louder. They still don't understand what you're saying. Num nuts. Learn the communication. That's what this is. Look at MS, multiple sclerosis. The conventional story is what? Autoimmunity, right? The immune system attacks the myin. Why? Why? Deeper layer to this is oligodendrite vulnerability. Oligodendrites are the cells that produce and maintain the myelin sheath that insulates your nerve. It's the covering on the wire. This produces a fantastically energy int or this process is fantastically energy intensive by the way requires what did I say the brain eats up 20%. That's a lot man for a three lb organytes are packed with mitochondria. So when their mitochondria fail the myelin sheath begins to deteriorate. So the immune system this is why this is what happens. They the immune system sees the debris of broken myelin and just goes nuts. It launches an attack. It's cleaning up the mess. It's doing its job. SS31 protects the illegody site mitochondria. If you 2021 act neuropathologica the journal showed SS31 treatment in experimental autoimmune and sephilomiolitis EA which is the standard model for MS 70% reduction in demyelination lesions and a complete prevention of a disability progression by maintaining a liodender site metabolic integrity. Okay. So the immune system attack never gained a foothold. But but are you getting why? Because there was no breakdown to attack. This is the problem. I could do this with every single disease. And so if you're going, "Okay, so the answer is to take SS31." No. The answer is to make your body immune to pathology by making the environment inhospitable to pathology by maintain Why do you think they want you fat, broke, stressed, cortisol soaked, anxious, miserable inside, never touching grass? Like they just they Why do you think that's by by chance? They want you staring at your phone all day in a dark room, right? Just rubbing one out to the weirdest crap you can find online 18 times a day for crying out loud. Go outside, get in your car, park in a field, and go have sex with your spouse on a sunny day. It might do you some good. Walk around. Let yourself see the sun. Sunglasses, sunscreen, all bunk. You guys are afraid. Don't even get me started on sunscreen. Oh, but I use this organic one. It's way better. You're supposed to be The sun doesn't give you cancer, by the way. Holy. That could be a whole other podcast. Let me know if you want to see that one. I'll tear that apart. Oh, I'll tear it a new butthole for sure. Look at the heart. This is a I am very protective of this thing. Your heart is a mitochondrial organ. Those sites are 40% mitochondria by volume. That's a lot. 40% of this mug of coffee, right? They have to be. Think of it. They have to be. Every beat requires this colossal surge of ATP. In heart failure, the mitochondria become incredibly inefficient. They become leaky. They become swollen and they produce less ATP and much more RLS reactive oxygen species. So they create this vicious cycle of energetic deficiency and oxidative damage. The heart muscle then does what? It weakens. So SS31 is cardiorive not by thinning your blood or lowering cholesterol, but by it's so stupid. It drives me nuts. All you statin mongers and you blood pressure mongers. Nope. It does it by repairing the cardiac muscle's power supply. A clinical study out of Harvard Medical School showed that a single infusion of SS31 in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction improved myio myioardial efficiency myioardial energy efficiency measured by phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. They have this whole process that they do. It improved mito it improved myocardial energy efficiency by 35% within 4 hours. Four freaking hours. The heart muscle got an immediate, measurable, quantifiable, provable energy upgrade. Okay? I could do this all day. I'm 28 minutes and I could do this all day. Listen, the secret they really don't want you to know. The reason this isn't on every single news desk on the planet, SS31 just it doesn't just make sick people less sick. It's what I said at the beginning. It makes old biology young. Aging is the accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction. The research is unequivocal. Cell metabolism, there's a study in cell metabolism gave aged 32-month-old mice, the equivalent of an 80year-old human, by the way, SS31. 10 weeks. That's how long it took. 10 weeks. Their mitochondrial membrane potential, which is a key measure of energetic health, restored to levels indistinguishable from young 6-month-old mice. It's a big friaking difference. Their muscle fatigue resistance increased by 50%. Their cognitive function measured by something called Morris water maze test improved 40%. This isn't showing decline. You know what that is? It's the Rword reversal. The secret is in the specificity. Just so you know, SS31 has an almost eerie, it's freaky, ability to target only the most damaged mitochondria. Healthy mitochondria with their intact, negatively charged membranes just repel the peptide. It's like a targeted rescue mission for cellular components that have passed the point of no return. This has incredibly profound implications, by the way, for the ETC because when SS31 patches the leaky inner mitochondrial membrane, it completely changes the thermodynamics of energy production. Energy leakage is a waste, right? It's inefficiency. So, by preventing the escape of electrons, SS31 forces them down the intended path through complexes 1 to4, right? Through everything they're supposed to, maximizing the proton gradient across that membrane. So this stronger gradient means every rotation of ATP synthi which means that every rotation of the ATP synthes turbine it makes the ATP go what I said yesterday vertical generates more ATP. The efficiency gain isn't incremental by the way it's transformative. Oxygen consumption efficiency usually improves 40 to 50%. It's like giving your cells a permanent energy subsidy. And yet people are still going where's my Monster energy drink? And this is why the disease business hates this. How about just talk money for a second. The chronic disease industry is the largest most profitable business. I've said it before in human history. It depends on subscription models. Monthly biologics for autoimmune conditions, insulin for diabetics, fusions for cancer, memory care for dementia, Alzheimer's drugs, just so you know, that fail. Yeah. 99.6% of the time generate billions of dollars. That's a big number of failure, by the way. 99.6. This is research, by the way. It's not me just throwing numbers at you. Cancer drugs that extend life by a few months cost over a half a million dollars. This is not a cure business. It's a customer retention business. A one-time repair of the fundamental cause of disease is existentially threatening this model up, down, and sideways. It's bad for quarterly earnings, right? But listen, SS31's power is amplified exponentially when you understand order of operations. I'm not talking about PEMDAS. You don't just take it. The sequence is everything. And this is where people f this up all day because of the bro science instab brohd wannabe Reddit forum. I can't I am so fragile with my ego. I have to tell you what's right. If you don't like it, you're wrong. I'm going to attack you, bros. It's ridiculous. Understand the fundamentals of practical biochemistry before you open your bark hole. I'm trying to help you. I'm not coming out here marketing anything. What do I say? Join the black card. It's great. $9,997. Join the Blackard. It's a one-year membership. It's a wire transfer only. I don't do credit cards anymore because I can't stand credit cards. And all they want to do is get in your way and tell you when and how you can use and spend your money and how much they can take from you. Forget it. I just said I'm out. $9,997. Apply unlockthecard.com. That's where you go. That's direct line to Jen, my CFO, and she will send you the wire information. It's not a bunch of questions. If you ask her a bunch of questions, she's going to ignore the email. Either you want in or you want out. It's a way to actually have me answer your questions. It's not one-on-one on a phone call. It's my live Q&A that I do every Monday. And it is in my you get into my VIP community. You get all the protocols I've used for decades that work. I've seen over a million patients. I most doctors will never see that in 50 years cuz they're not helping people. They're prescribing to people. I'm just solving problems cuz I actually give a crap. But that's it. Join. If not, then don't. Buy from Elite Biogenics or don't. Everything we do is 100% tested up, down, and sideways for everything. Nobody does it like we do. My company's legit. But decide. I'm still going to come out here and give you the information. Don't buy from me then. I don't care. I'm still going to give you the info cuz somebody's got to do it. And I'm not doing it to market to you going, "By the way, I'm having a Black Friday sale. It's Black Friday today. You know what's on sale? Nothing. It's the same price. I don't change. I think it's stupidest thing I've ever seen. We take holidays and make them sales events. You want in?" There's the barrier to entry. Costs money. It costs time. It costs energy. So, here's the sequence you need to do because you guys are screwing this up. You do not ever take SS31 before M C. The biochemistry, the physiology doesn't even make sense. It's like you're driving off a cliff and you're trying to fix the steering wheel. Keep it from going off the cliff first, then fix everything else. You guys got it backwards. Step one, MZ C. And think about it, MS C. I'll just I'll go through the whole sequence of mitochondrial repair for you. How about that? M C, it's not a peptide. It's a demo crew. Essentially, MOS C is the mitochondrial derived peptide that upregulates AMPK signaling, right? EMPK, I just talked about it, the master regulator of catabolism. It tells the cell to break down old dysfunctional components for energy. Specifically, by the way, MOS C induces a comprehensive, which is the targeted recycling of damaged mitochondria. So, what it's doing is it's clearing out the dead wood. Huh. Sounds to me like it's a controlled burn that makes space for new growth. Just a thought. Human clinical data watch. Mott C administration increases markers of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC1 alpha by the way and NRF1 TFAB 2 TFM 300% over 4 weeks. Find me anything that does that. Find me any of your little health food supplements or your guy that's drinking his own piss. Find any of that. You can't. You are literally instructing your body to tear down its broken factories with Mi. That's the point. You guys have to understand. I wish it was mandatory to understand physiology, biology, and and basic biochemistry instead of I don't even know, social media, tech, Instagram posting 101. I don't really know what they teach in school anymore, but I don't think it's helping anybody. Step two is SS31. Now you bring in the architect. Watch. After MC has created a cellular environment primed for renewal, got rid of all the busted factories, SS31 comes in to protect the mitochondrial networks. It embeds itself in the inner mitochondrial membrane of new mitochondria, ensuring that they operate like silk. Peak efficiency from their very first day of operation. It's the difference between building a house and building a fortified house. Just so you know, studies on the combination show synergistic effect. Mod C followed studies, real research studies, you guys. That's why these guys like, you have to take SS31 first. It's the stupidest thing. You guys got it backwards. It's because some idiot bro science went, well, you have to repair it first. And that doesn't even make sense because that means they don't understand the pharmacodnamics. They don't understand the biochemistry. They don't understand physiology. They sure as hell don't understand cell function. So MOT C this is they research shows study show M C followed by SS31 increases mitochondrial density and function by 80% more than any other compound alone ever. But we're only two compounds in. Watch. Here's let's go over a beautifully engineered resilience package. Methylene blue. It's not a dye. It's an electron cyclinger. And at low before you go hypertension and nitric oxide and all the stuff that you guys keep keep hitting me with. Let me explain. Low doses. Hypothetically for a kangaroo I stick around 1 to two milligrams. You don't have to take these giant doses. They want you to cycle through it more. At low doses, it accepts electrons from NADH and shuttles them directly to cytochrome C. It bypasses the damaged complex 1 and three. It's a metabolic bypass surgery that increases ATP production by anywhere from 30 to 60%. It averages 50%. From what I read this morning, it averages 50% almost immediately while also acting as a incredible antioxidant. NAD+. So NAD+ is the essential co-actor for the certuin family of enzymes, right? Cert 3. Certuins are the guardians of the genome and the mitochondria, right? They're the ones that make sure they're okay. They regulate DNA repair. They control. They optimize metabolic function, but they require one thing to work. NAD+. Aging and mitochondrial dysfunction deplete NAD+. So restoring it is like paying the salaries of your cellular maintenance crew. So now combined with SS31, this stack of all these things creates a very virtuous cycle. More energy. SS-31 methylene blue allows for better repair suins which creates healthier mitochondria which produce what? More ATP. That's it. You guys are complicating things. I had some guys send me a message. I've even had people in my group. They're taking like 15 different peptides at once. Why? You have so much cross talk and so much going on your body and they wonder why they get a herk reaction because their body is just dumping stuff like they no bentonite clay, no activated charcoal to bind it. It's just a disaster. You guys have to be smart with your physiology and listen to people like me that tell you what to do and help you. Like I said, if you want to buy from my company, great. If you don't, that's on you. You take the chances. But either way, I'm going to give you the right answer. This protocol doesn't ask your body to get better. You know that it forces it to. There's this elephant in the room. I wasn't going to talk about it because I was going to do a whole podcast on it, but cancer. I had somebody, a lot of you guys are so afraid of cancer. They've got you so conditioned. The war on cancer has been spectacular, right? It's this trillion dollar failure because we're fighting the wrong faking enemy. We've been targeting the symptoms of cancer, rapidly dividing cells with chemical and nuclear weapons. We've been trying to kill the smoke while ignoring the dang fire. The fire is metabolic. 1931, this guy Otto Warberg won the Nobel Prize for his discovery that cancer cells have a fundamentally different metabolism. Holy [ __ ] how many of you guys knew that they ferment glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen? This is called the Warberg effect, by the way. For decades, it was seen as this quirky side effect, except now they know 100% and now so do you. It's the central cause. Go back to my three biological failures. Just remember them. That's all. I'll just leave it at that. Strange, huh? Cancer cells have severely damaged mitochondria. Their electron transport chains are broken. They cannot produce sufficient energy through oxidative phosphorilation. So they revert to a primitive, inefficient form of energy production called glycolysis. But in order to make this work, they need massive amounts of fuel, glucose, and they need to silence the signals that would normally tell a broken cell to die. So let me unpack this. Watch this is once you see this, you'll never unsee it. Look back at the three failures. Now, insulin resistance provides the endless fuel supply. High blood glucose. Oh, this should freak you out. You should, your skin should be crawling right now. Systemic inflammation provides the growth signals and mutagenic environment. And ATP shortage creates the selective pressure that favors cells that can survive without functional mitochondria. Three biological failures. Every disease, I am right. I am always right about this. I know damn well every single freaking disease comes from these three failures only. They've been lying to you. They've been lying to me. They've been lying to the world, trying to get you to subscribe to their narrative so they make more money off of your sickness. Cancer is not a genetic disease. I'm tired of people going, "It runs in my family." No, it doesn't. It runs in your habits. It is a metabolic adaptation to a toxic, energy-deprived cellular environment. Your body in a state of metabolic crisis selects for cancer cells. Period. Listen. SS31 by restoring mitochondrial function removes the need for this adaptation. It fixes the root cause. It doesn't poison the cancer cell. It makes the cancer cell obsolete. There's research in cell reports demonstrating that restoring mitochondrial function in the tumor micro environment using compounds precisely or specifically SS reduced tumor growth by 70% and completely prevented the metastasis of aggressive models of breast cancer. How many of you women are afraid of that? The cancer cells when confronted with functional mitochondria and proper energy signaling underwent redifferiation and apoptosis. They were told to resume their normal function or die. And they couldn't, so they died. The research proving this is avoidable is overwhelming. Listen, the EPIC study following over half a million people, 500,000 people for 15 years found that individuals who maintained metabolic health, normal insulin sensitivity, low inflammation, 65% lower incidence of all cancers than those with metabolic syndrome. A 2015 paper in Nature concluded that 70 to 90% of cancer risk factors are environmental and med metabolic, not genetic. This is not theoretical, you guys. This is epidemiological fact. And through all of this, the safety profile of SS31, just so you know, is immaculate. And they'll tell you to be afraid of this stuff. You got to be afraid. Watch out. What if it's this is for research use only? It's not for human use. It's not for animal use. What should I do? I better not take it. I better go take chemotherapy because it's FDA approved. Are you high? There's not a single study in any modern organism or human trial that has shown any significant adverse effect. Its LD50 is astronomically high. Its mechanism is so exquisitly specific, targeting only damaged phospholipid in specific organel that it's perhaps one of the most precisely targeted therapeutic agents ever developed SS31. So we're left with a choice, right? The choice between two models of medicine. Model one is the endless management model. It says you're broken. Your genes are faulty. Your body is an enemy to be controlled. It offers a lifetime of pills and potions and lotions and inject injections and treatments that manage symptoms while the underlying disease process continues unabated. It is incredibly stupendously profitable and it's the status quo for most of you guys and you'll argue to defend it. Model two, the mitochondrial model. Three, biological failures model. Mine says your body is a self-repairing system of unimaginable sophistication says that disease is a consequence of fundamental energy and signaling failure. It offers not a lifetime of management but a repair of the dang foundation. It is mechanistic. It is provable by research and it is deeply profoundly disruptive to the economics of all disease. SS31 is the key to the second model. It is the mechanic for the engines of your life. Please listen to what I'm saying. Like the system doesn't like messages that threaten its revenue, which is why they try and silence men doctors like me. I think we're done with that system. How about you? I got to go. Never miss.
