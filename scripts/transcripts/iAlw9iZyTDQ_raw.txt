All right, I got to answer I got to answer a question for you guys. One of you guys asked me, you sent me a message. You drink a lot of coffee. Do you really think that's safe? Coffee is one of the most studied substances on the planet. If they could patent it and package it and make it a prescription. It would be number one on their hit parade because it would make them so much money. The benefits of caffeine are astronomical. And the people that run around going, "It's inauthentic energy." And this isn't about coffee, but it drives me nuts. It's not real. It's terrible for you. Oh, you're out of your mind. The benefits. You guys, you know what? If you guys want me to do a full deep dive science, biochemistry, endocrinology, the neurology behind why caffeine specifically, why coffee outside of if before you guys get in my comments and start talking about the mold and all the stuff in it, real just get coffee. Get your own coffee beans if you have to and grind them yourself. Invader coffee. You know what? Go see my buddy Wes Whitlock. I trust him and I it's an innocent plug. I don't get any money from Wes. He's just a really good friend of mine. So, Rogue American Apparel. That's what he owns. And he owns Invader Coffee and I trust him. If he says it's clean coffee, it's clean coffee. But if you guys want me to do a deep dive on coffee and caffeine and how beneficial it is and the hows and wise and what fors and the chemistry behind it, then somebody send me a message. Just send it to me on social media and I'll do it. I'm trying to answer as many questions as I can on this planet before I die. And I have a lot of years left. So, I'm going to just keep banging out answers for you guys to give you the stuff. This is one that I've been getting a ton of qu requests for. Thousands of you guys have asked me about this about the FDA and Redat True Tide. Now, I'll tell you this, man. Redatride is dangerous. It's wicked dangerous for the FDA and for big pharma. It's a game changer. Listen, you guys don't understand how much you've been lied to. It's one of these things that if there was a real, they just won't like Eli Liy is trying to patent it to make it a the next Oz Peak, the next Zepbound, whatever it is, but they're going to listen to me. If you buy it from these companies, I'll tell you this, if you buy it from these companies, you guys are all worried about buying your supplements from some guy in a in the back of the gym or in the back of the locker, some guy named Trent or Derek who gets it from China. First of all, things from China aren't as bad as you think. I'm not saying it cuz I promote it. I'm just saying you are led to believe like I own a company in China. I have for well over a decade. It has nothing to do with peptides, by the way. You can just look it up. And it's has to do with body hacks. I teach people how to do all the stuff that I did for decades and help people. All the stuff I used to post videos about. The point I'm making is what and what you know are two totally different things. So be careful because I used to have people come into my clinic and be like, "Oh my god, did you see China?" I'm like, "I know hundreds of people there." And it's that's what you're seeing is not what's going on. I'm not promoting it before you guys get all weird in my comments. I'm just it's like I got a bug the size of an acorn in my eye right now. But I want you guys to understand something that you're worried about buying supplements that are some weird off label, not FDA approved, not from a very specific pharmacy. That is the hypnosis of social conditioning that you guys are so conditioned to buy from a an organization that you think has your best interest in mind. Are you out of your ever? Are you high? Follow the science. What are we four five years? What kind of damage did that cause to people? I can't. I can't. You guys, for [ __ ] sakes, I can't, man. Like, really, it makes me that angry. I've cussed on a podcast for a long time. It makes me that angry because you guys are listening to people that have no desire for your health. None. You Okay, listen. How much do you guys all pay me? How much? How much? You guys pay me billions and billions of dollars. Do I own a trillion dollar company? No. I'm a dude in a baseball hat, 52year-old g athlete slashd doctor slash husband and father who just comes out here for free every day to help you. I'm not being paid to do any of this. I actually like you need to look at the reason like my best interest is or is you. I have your best interest in mind. I just want you to have the information. They go buy my product and avoid everything else. I'm never saying that. I like what do I say every time? Buy from Elite Biogenics, knock yourself out. Great. I already know our stuff is tested up, down, and sideways and legit. And I know that like my lab is killer. I know because if I wouldn't put it in myself or my family, I'm sure as hell not going to do it to anybody else cuz I'm wired like that. Most people ask any big pharma CEO if they'll take their own stuff. Nope. Should be bells going off in your head, you guys. This is why the FDA is trying to shut down, hide, bury, criminalize, demonize, re at True Tide. That's the only reason because it works. And it shuts down their model of manage decline and disease subscription safety [ __ ] If you look at what was it, not NZT. My eye is really bugging me right now. NZ, not NZT. Now you got me thinking of Limitless. Like Bradley Cooper is going to walk in, right? No, which was for AIDS when the AIDS epidemic came out, right? Which is another load of crap. And that drug was approved in 3 weeks. You see some similarities here? It caused a ton of problems. And you know what the prominent side effects and there are only effects and but I'll get to the rat true tide to things like site and why they should be afraid of it and why you guys should not. The side effects of ACT are basically immunosuppression. They're AIDS symptoms. They're HIV symptoms and it doesn't do anything for HIV. I don't care who's out there. Show me the research. I can bury you in research that says that will prove you wrong if you say it does anything wonderful. Now I realize you can look online now and find research to support just about anything. But at the same time, look who funded it. God, you guys have been lied to so much. FDA approval is the dumbest thing in the world in my opinion. My opinion, I have to say that because heaven forbid, right? This is just a guy and a microphone and a cup of coffee sitting here on a Tuesday afternoon. I'm looking over my shoulder, by the way, or over here. And I have this huge 150 in 4TV screen. You guys saw it the other day when I did a video on migraines. And it's got the Roku background on it. And I just saw one of the buildings that said Roku City. I don't know if you guys have seen these screen savers that run and they're all like purple. They got you could just sit there and pick out movies like crazy. all this stuff. There's a whole story going on. Distraction, right? Distraction. I just like the visual noise in the background. But listen, here's let me explain about Reddit truth. Like you guys have been lied to. You really have. Not by me. You guys like and not a little white lie. This is a trillion dollar life destroying generation crippling lie that you guys are just consuming. Like it it's the gospel truth. You guys just keep going FDA. It's not I get you guys in my questions all the time. It's not FDA approved. That really makes me nervous. It says for research use only that only. That makes me nervous. Then don't do it. Then go back to your Tylenols and your vaccinations and all the stuff that you think they have your best interest in mind, but then look at the numbers and go, "Huh? Why is everybody getting more sick?" Cover up that, too. Listen, the people who told this lie, they're the ones wearing the white coats with the God complex. They write the prescriptions. They own the medical journals. They are terrified about what I'm going to show you. I'm not here to give you some long-winded podcast. I'm going to perform an autopsy on the entire sick care industry. And the body hasn't even gotten cold yet, baby. So listen, start with the patient. You start with the patient. You, let's start bare bones, right? Let's start with the patient. You, your body is this quantum biological supercomput, right? Agreed? And it runs on one currency, adenazine triphosphate. You need to understand the basics if you're going to understand what I'm going to talk about. So if you go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, boring, then I'm probably not for you. Adenazine triphosphate, ATP. This is the energy molecule of life. Every thought, every heartbeat, every eyelink, every iris contraction, every muscle contraction anywhere is an ATP transaction across a desk. You are an ATPdriven economy. Period. 30 trillion cells, 30 trillion cities inside you. That's you. Most of you are frighteningly bankrupt and have accepted it as a disease. You're running a deficit. No business would survive like that, but we do it. You're energy poor. And that poverty has a name. the three biological failures that me, Dr. Trevor Bachmier, has come up with and proven time and time and time again. So, let me hit these real quick so you understand why reatritis, it's a lifecher. Systemic inflammation is the first one. Your body is this war zone. Cytoines like TNF alpha and interlucan 6, right? IL6. They're these internal artillery that's shelling your own tissues 24/7, 365. The second one is insulin resistance. Your cells have locked the doors, barricaded them with as much debris as they possibly can and your master energy hormone insulin is knocking with glucose and nobody's answering and they're just they just keep piling debris in front of it. The sugar stays in your blood, toxic glycating proteins frying your nerves. And three, the ATP shortage. The power plants of your cells, the little nuclear reactors called mitochondria are sputtering and dying and inefficient and producing more oxidative stress than they are producing usable energy. This is the unholy trinity I've said of all modern disease and people get mad. My grandma had, my dad had, my mom had, still had the same problems. You should want to understand this because if you understand it, it can be fixed. See, that's why I do this. I want you to understand this. Now, how do they treat all this stuff? They don't. They manage the symptoms. I'll get to Reddit truth in a second, but they sell you subscriptions to your own decline. High blood pressure, here's a beta blocker. Cholesterol problem, no such thing, by the way. Here's a statin. Sugar, metformin, right away. SSRI for the depression that comes from your brain, starving for energy. I could do this all day. They're putting band-aids on bullet holes that are in you, and it's the most lucrative business model in human history ever. There has never been a business model like this. People come to this country that are from other countries and I've even say I've been all over the world and I've spoken all over the world and I have a lot of friends all over the world and the one thing they have in common is when they watch American TV are the drug ads. They go we don't have drug and attorney ads. They we don't have any of this stuff. This is crazy. This is nuts. It's like every second ad is a drug ad. You guys are being bombarded and you don't even know it. You just accept it as normal social media. I can't turn on YouTube without having an ad. It just it's wild. Listen, let's talk numbers because corruption is measured in dollars. Agreed? So, the global Alzheimer market, 15 billion a year and growing. Diabetes care, it's about 500 billion. Fatty liver disease, depression, and anxiety. You're looking at a trillion dollar ecosystem of human misery. There's no joy in this. It's a managed decline industry. It's more than oil. It's more than anything else. And their customer isn't you. That's what you think. It's not you. It's your diagnosis. It's your label. Their business is to keep you as a re recurring revenue patient, not a cured one. They do not want you. A cured customer is always what I say. What a lost customer. Let me explain the thing they're trying to bury read a true tide. Buckle up. You've heard of it. I've talked about it plenty of times and I could talk about this. I could do an entire thesis, like a full master's degree on this. It's so effective and I know that much about it because I made sure of it. Triple agonist, right? It's the super weight loss drug. What a croc of garbage. That's the cover story. The marketing misdirection from keeping you from seeing what it really is. That is not what it is. It is not a weight loss drug. It's not at all. It's not a weight loss peptide. It's not a weight loss injection. It has nothing to do with weight loss. That's an accessory. Redatride is a mitochondrial reprogramming agent. It's a signal. It is a master key to so much in your physiology. I'll explain. Watch. It agonizes three receptors, right? GLP1, GIP, and glucagon. So GLP-1 and GIP, they're the insulin sensitizing, appetite regulating keys. But glucagon is the skeleton key. You know what that is? Just goes in multiple places and it unlocks all kinds of stuff. The glucagon is a hormone of energy liberation. It tells your liver to break down glycogen and fat to make fuel. For the easiest way, I was going to give it a more biochemistry explanation, but there's no no need. Just breaks down glycogen and fat for fuel. The pharmaceutical narrative focuses on the first two because they're safe. They're about restriction. But the magic, baby, the absolute biological revolution is then the third one. Fat glucagon red a true tide tells your body one primal command. That's it. Mobilize and utilize, baby. So it forcibly comes in and it unlocks your fat stores, especially the ones that kill you. The visceral fat, deadly visceral fat. Yes, you may as well call it what it is. Stop blowing it off. That stuff kills you. It's choking your organs. And it and instead of doing that, it shoves that same energy into your mitochondria. It's not about eating less. It's about using more. They're not the same. We're in this life of restriction. That's ridiculous. It solves the ATP shortage at its source. Listen, let me explain this real fat. It's not just a storage depot. It's not. It's an endocrine organ from hell. It pumps out inflammatory cytoines, which you know are just so by now, if you've listened to me for any amount of time, you know they're disastrous. TNF alpha IL6, right? Tumor necrosis factor is what TNF stands for. Somebody asked me IL's interlucan. It increases angotensinogen spikes blood pressure because of that. It drips free fatty acids directly into your portal vein, floods your liver, causes insulin resistance. It's a factory of this is the factory. This is the factory right there. Not a good one. This is a factory of all those biological failures. Just three. Listen, if you could solve three problems in your life and it mitigated every disease process that would you would could ever possibly show up. Why would you not do it? What are you afraid of? Really, what are you afraid of? I want you healthy. I'm selfish. I'm so selfish. I want you healthy. I want you so healthy. I want you a juggernaut. I want you to be so indestructible that people just go you never get sick. This woman never gets sick. Their whole family, they got good genetics. No, they have working genetics. They have working biology. That disgusting factory that spikes the blood pressure that just increases angotensinogen that just does all these terrible things. Red atrutide goes in and dismantles this factory piece by piece. It does here I'll even explain how it works. It does this by activating glucon receptors on atyposytes. It triggers HSL hormone sensitive lipase. This isn't gentle lipolysis by the way. It is a raid like they're kicking in the doors. It liberates free fatty acids. It shuttles them to the liver and to the muscle to be burned for energy. The ATP shortage ends. The lights come back on and f just follow the energy. Watch. This is how awesome this is. The brain consumes about 20% of your body's ATP. An energy starved brain is a dysfunctional brain. Period. Full stop. In Alzheimer's, we see amaloid plaques, tyotangles. Sure. But what's beneath that? Crippled mitochondria and insulin resistant neurons. I went over dementia and Alzheimer's very deeply and I explained it. I got a lot of phone calls and a lot of messages from people that desperately need my help which I'm there's only one of me man but these neurons are starving. Reddit truide fixes the defuel delivery. It upregulates something called PGC1 alpha which is the master regulator of bio of mitochondrial rather biogenesis. It builds new nuclear reactors. It increases cerebral blood flow. And it's not just protecting neurons you guys. It's taking them and throwing superchargers on them making them work infinitely better than they ever did. How about MS? I want to pick apart all these diseases. In fact, this might be a really long episode, so you might want to go get a coffee and then come back. Multiple sclerosis, autoimmunity, is fundamentally inflamed, energy deprived nervous tissue. That's what it is. So, by crushing systemic inflammation and giving a clean abundant energy source, you remove two two primary drivers of demiination. Two, the research on GLP1 agonist alone shows massive neuroprotective effects. Redatrite is that exponentiated your heart. How about this thing? The mioardium has the highest mitochondrial density of any tissue in the human body. It runs on ATP or it dies and it's beating right now as you're listening to this. Heart failure is at its core an energy crisis. Redatride delivers this torrent of efficient fuel and improves calcium handling because of the voltage gated calcium channels in the heart. Right? Calcium handling in cardommyiocytes increases ejection fraction. I have a a client who's a good friend of mine, Mike, who improved his ejection fraction by 20%. He is a they he was going to die, man. He's in his late 20s, multiple heart attacks, and he's fit now. He's fit. He's married. He's got kids. He's a great This guy's a stud. Him and his wife are amazing. But let me explain something. This guy was on his way out because of managed decline. He decided to go up yours and do it himself and listen to this guy. Between the two of us, he's an entirely he's a superhuman. The way you're supposed to be, by the way, just so you get where I'm going with this, you're supposed to be like that. So red tide isn't just cardioprotective. It's cardio supercharging just like the neurons. HBA1C, right? That's a measure of glycation, which is sugar rotting your blood proteins over 3 months. Redatride's insulin sensitiv insulin sensitiviving insulin sensitizing effects are so powerful that it normalizes glucose disposal. Oh, but it goes deeper. This is where it gets fun. By solving the ATP shortage, listen to this. Your cells are now hungry for glucose. So they pull it out of your bloodstream. Veraciously the HBA1C drops. Not because you're blocking sugar. But because your cells are actually using it, they're not the same. Right? If you block the sugar, the problem is still there. You just don't see it. You know how easily they can they do manipulate lab work. If your number changes on a scale, that doesn't mean you're healthy. I am 200 lb. Right? I'll use this just as a very simple example of the math that they can be manipulated. I am 200 lb. I am lean and fit and athletic and I rub I run a sub 23k with one balloon with one lung. Right? This one's gone. How many of you know somebody that's 200 lb? How many of you are 200 lb that aren't fit, aren't athletic? I'm not saying it to be insulting. That number on the scale doesn't mean anything. That's why this is frightening. So, if HBA1C drops because you're blocking sugar, have you actually solved the problem? No. But the white coat comes up and hands you a prescription. You know, so glad we gave you that. We handled the met we gave you metformin. I'm so glad we handled the sugar problem, but you never handled the problem at all. You just changed you just changed a lab result. This gets your cells to finally use the sugar. So, you actually solve the problem. Sticking your head in the sand does not change the problem. It doesn't make the problem go away. How about the cancer scare? God, I heard this the other day. You guys need to listen to me. I've been through it. My wife has resuscitated me, seen me fall apart, watched Vin Kristen drip into my vein. I wouldn't let them put a board in doing the arm. They said, "It's easier." I said, "For who? Not easier for me. You're not getting a direct line to my heart." She slept on a tiny little green couch in the hospital during recovery after they pulled my lung out, pulled a tumor out of my chest. Cancer is very real. I'm not saying it's not. Before you guys go, "Oh, what? Cancer?" No, but cancer is man-made. I'm sure that's going to get me in trouble. I really don't care. This is what they do with retatrite. If they can't get you to not do it and they can't block it, they scare you into avoiding it. This is the one they'll use to fearmonger. The rodent study about this thyroid sea cell tumors. Here's the irrefutable science that they ignore. You ready? Human sea cells have dramatically fewer GLP1 receptors than rodents. When I say dramatically, orders of magnitude. The biological relevance is not even negligible. It's zero. The FDA's own reviewers have acknowledged they've even but yeah, that's true. There is zero evidence of carcinogenesis in human trials. Zero. It's a ghost. It's a whisper. You got nothing. It's a narrative weapon. Meanwhile, the three biological failures courtesy of Dr. T. Obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, ATP shortage. I realize it's three. They fall into the same cate proven drivers of cancer. Tell me I'm wrong. Here's what Red True Tide does. Treats the soil that the cancer grows in. There you go. Mic drop. Listen, I could do this with depression and anxiety. The chemical imbalance theory is a bankrupt myth sold to you by pharma to move pills, not to solve the problem. The research is crystal clear. Depression is a metabolic disorder of the brain. Proven research. It's low ATP production, neuroinflammation, and insulin resistance in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. SSRIs are dirty, nasty drugs. They cause long-term downregulation of serotonin receptors, massive sexual dysfunction, and a bunch of emotional blunting. They treat nothing. They treat nothing. They chemically castrate your emotional range. Read a true type fixes the core pathology. The energy deficit which is the problem. The brain fog lifts because of the fog of war. The inflammation clears and the power is restored. The problem is it's really not that complicated once you understand it. They don't want you to understand it. So I could sit here and spin a bunch of big words and throw some biochemistry together and make you go, I don't know what the hell this guy's even talking about, but it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. And then at the end I should go I could say don't do this. And you'll go sounds smart, so I better not do it. That's the problem is you guys aren't understanding the research. So, I'm trying to give you all the information, give you the biology and physiology. I don't do this for me. I do it for you. I already know this stuff. I want you guys to know it. Somebody asked me if there if redatride could be a forever peptide. Absolutely. I've talked about this before. Absolutely. Because at lowd dose, redatruide isn't it's not a hard-hitting wrecking ball. It's a hormone replacement therapy for a signal our modern environment has suppressed. It's a perpetual tuning of your metabolism. It maintains insulin sensitivity, keeps inflammation, scorched earth, and it ensures your mitochondrial furnaces are burning hot, clean, and just churning out fat yields of ATP non-stop. It builds a very robust biology by enforcing metabolic efficiency. It makes your body do what it's designed to do. It gets better. Here, I'll even tell you some synergy that makes this so badass. You're going to go, I, how do I do this? I'll just tell you. This is where the true magic is. Think of your biology as a castle. Three biological failures are the invaders at the gate. Okay? Red at true tide is your army. It marches out, defeats the invaders, this real fat, call it that, and secures the energy supply, ATP. Okay, there's part one. Oh, we're not done. Now it gets fun. Methylene blue. Come in with methylene blue. It's like the master engineer. It's an ex. It's an electron cyclinger. It slips into the mitochondrial electron transport chain, the etc. It does it at complex 4. Bypasses the blocks and the restrictions and it reducing the electron leakage which is the oxidative stress and skyrockets ATP production efficiency by about 30 to 40%. It's a direct ATP supercharger that never burns out the engine. Also imp improves cerebral blood flow and is one of the most potent anti-inflammatories on the planet. Oh, I'm not done. M. You don't have to get complicated. You just have to get your system dialed in and put things together properly. MOS C is like a royal decree from not to from the nucleus mitochondrial derived peptide. I've talked about this before. It leaves a mitochondria, goes into the nucleus, reprograms gene expression for metabolic efficiency, and then enhances insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization at a genetic level. So watch together. This is why it's such a bad is so awesome. Redatide provides the fuel. Methylene blue optimizes the engine. And M C rewrites the engine's operating manual. So the stack doesn't just manage disease, it obsoletes it. There is none because this make yourself inhospitable to a pathology and a pathology will never show up. This is why the establishment is terrified. Redatrite is an existential threat. It proves that most chronic disease, incurable diseases are metabolic failures and they're reversible. It blows apart the subscription model. Just disintegrates it. one course of treatment that restores health is a financial disaster for them. And here's what's interesting before you guys start asking. If you're like, if I have to take this for the rest of my life, you just said reatrides a forever peptide. Sure. You drink water, you eat food. Did you solve the problem? If you stop readide, is the problem gone? Yes. Is it smart to maintain it at a higher level? Absolutely. You can stop all you want. It's a changes the set point. If you stop metformin and you don't do anything about your physiology, is the problem gone? No. What about a Humalogue pump that's sitting there [ __ ] insulin into your system? Is it Is the problem gone? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. They put you on L-dopa. Does that make the problem go away? No. In fact, that actually makes it significantly worse. I could do this all day with every disease. Core of any intervention to make you healthy is always the same. Did you solve it or manage it? They have convinced you that managing is the only way. But if you solve it, watch you unplug all the things you're taking. If you solve it, they don't come back. If you manage it, you unplug everything you're taking and it comes back with roaring vengeance subscription model. Even if you had to take this for the rest of your life, even if you did, what do you spend a couple hundred bucks a month? But you get your life, right? Not even that. You guys will spend $1,000 a month, man. I've seen people spend 89 $10,000 a month on a freaking car. A car. I don't listen. I love cars. I absolutely car watch. I love all this stuff, but it's not more important than my health or the health of my wife or the health of my children. And when people go, "Then you should do this for free." I do come out here for free. When people ask me, "Can you get on a call and help me for free then? If you're such a good dude." I had one guy get mad at me because he said, "My I was too expensive." Then I'm not for you. That's okay. I'm not for everybody. Like the black card, $9,900. I only take a wire. I had a guy go, "Can I pay with a credit card?" Sure. If the credit card comes in the form of a bank wire to my bank, absolutely not. Bank wire only. Why? because I'm not giving credit cards the control over my finances anymore. Ever. So, if you want to join the Blackard, it's a one-year membership. This is no plug. I'm just People ask. The Blackard membership is one year, $9,997. I do a Q&A call every Monday at 5 and I do a call on Saturdays at 10:00. That's not a Q&A. That is fixing your broken belief system and all the excuses you come up with why you can't do something. And Monday is I solve every problem. Plus, you get the VIP community that I go in and I answer questions once a day. It's not on a video. I go in and I answer all the questions. It's really me. It's not AI. And I put in protocols at least one a week. Things I've used with real patients for decades and gotten astronomically beneficial results. It's 10 grand. Is there a payment plan? Nope. So, there you go. You want it? Support at Spartan ArmyLLC.com. And if you go, I'd like a little more information, I just gave it to you. I'm not going to My my staff isn't going to entertain a bunch of questions. They will tell you exactly what I said. You choose. I think it's the cheapest thing you'll ever buy and everybody in it goes, "You're undercharging." I agree. But the point is, I want you guys to be healthy and I want you to have a safe place to do it. So, come hang out with me or you just listen to these podcasts. Listen, you need to know something about the FDA. The FDA isn't coming out to make you healthy. They're not a public health agency. It's the pharmaceutical industry's regulatory capture. They will slow walk this. They will amplify the cancer fears. They will try to restrict it to the obese and the diabetic. They will do anything and everything to prevent healthy people from accessing it for prevention, for building a juggernaut biology. Because a healthy, listen to me, a healthy, metabolically optimized population doesn't need their drugs, doesn't need their statins or their SSRI or their blood pressure meds. It ends the trillion dollar ransom note. Your health, understand, I'm trying to give you the answers. Your health is not a mystery. It's not a lottery. It's a biological system that operates on fundamental laws of energy and inflammation. For decades, they have kept you in the dark, selling you candles while hiding the light switch that all you have to do is turn on. Red or true tide is the light switch, by the way. It's not about losing weight. It's not that's not what that it's not what Red True Tide does. You gain life. It's about cognitive clarity, boundless energy, a heart that pumps like a piston, lifespan that's not just longer, but healthier. There's so much research supporting this, it's almost frightening to support how amazing this stuff. The science is irrefutable. I say this every time. The only thing standing between you and all the things that you want, the biological renaissance is the corrupt system designed to keep you sick and broken. I honestly think the question isn't whether or not you should take Red True Tide. The question is whether or not you're ready to fire freaking doctors and hire new biologists. You hope that makes sense. Anyway, hope you got something out of this. I got to go. Never miss.
