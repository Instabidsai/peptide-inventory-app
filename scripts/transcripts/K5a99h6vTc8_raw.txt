This is a master class on carterine. So c a r d a r i ne e carterine. There's no t in the word. I know I'm not drinking coffee, right? It's water. I've been so thirsty lately. Anyway, carterine, man. I Carterine is wicked. Let me get this really Let me get this out of the way. I am 38 seconds in. Okay. Master class on carterine. No, it does not cause cancer. Period. Zero. Does not. Not at all. So, you can take that and I'll prove it. I'll show you the research study and prove how they manipulated the data to make you guys think that. And all the people running around saying, "Oh, what about this guy on Facebook?" You know what? Screw the guy on Facebook because I'm trying to give you things so you can have a better life and you can solve your problem. Listen, I'm going to start this one off a little differently. Okay? So, your biology isn't broken. You're convinced it's broken. Okay? It's not broken. It's not It's not failing. It's not weak. You know what it is? It's incredibly confused from a couple of things. Number one, all the misinformation being thrown around. Listen, I got nothing to sell you. I've got nothing to sell you. I don't care. You join the black card. Awesome. Apply atunlockthecard.com. Message Mia and she will take She's my personal executive assistant. She will take excellent care of you. It is $9,997 and you It is only wire transfer. No, you can't pause it. You can't transfer it. You can't give it to someone else. It is to make sure that you have direct access to me. You get access to my live Q&A call with me every Monday, plus the VIP community and you can send me labs, all you everything. You can send me a full intake. I don't care what you send me. I will help you. But I've turned around health on thousands and thousands of people now. The point is I want to help people for real. I don't care. And if you don't join well and you go, can't I just ask you a question? That's why I come out here. So I answer most of your questions. And if I don't, then your next step is a black card or doing one-on-one with me. And then I don't I also buy from Elite Biogenics or don't. That's up to you. Nobody tests as rigorously as I do and nobody has labs as tight as I do. And nobody has a system that they trust as much as I do where I will I refuse to let anything come out of my lab that I wouldn't give my wife or children. So if you want to buy from Elite Biogenics, awesome. If you don't, that's fine. I'm still going to give you the information. You do what you want with it. This is the point of being a doctor is not to run around waving a flag going, "Look at me. I'm a doctor." And just to get into arguments in the comments with a bunch of people that I've forgotten more than you'll know. And it's you guys go, "Well, that's egotistical." No, it's that I'm not arguing with some muppet on chat GPT. I've been a doctor for 30 years. I've seen over a million patients. And you can't replace that with a prompt. You just can't. And yep, there are a ton of doctors. And honestly, fully 95% of most medical students right now that should never become doctors. And when they do, they're just going to be legal pharmaceutical reps with a license and a very expensive yearly fee for malpractice insurance that they pay every month. That's it. But your biology is not wrecked. It's not wrecked. It's very confusing. And I'll explain it because carterine is man, I love carterine. It's so good. So I need you guys to just walk with me. Just walk with me. Okay. First of all, what if you guys know my theory and where's my Nobel Prize? All diseases, every single disease. Every single disease, they're not diseases. They're not. They're symptoms of three biological failures 100% of the time. So, before I talk about carterine, I need you guys to understand what we're solving for. In everything I do, I am always solving the same equation. Three biological failures. Because the differential diagnosis, you got to know what you're actually treating. Most people don't. And doctors come out and they go, "Let me open my little book or my little iPad now or my phone or my app or whatever." And patient A has these symptoms. What drug do we get? Give them the drug. If you watched my podcast on how big pharma wants you dead, just not yet. They want you dying slowly. So they don't want you too sick so you die, but they don't want you well enough that you don't need their product. So they get you just sick enough so you need their products for life. And the next thing creates the next thing creates the next thing creates the next thing. It's like Jenga, the disaster. You guys have to know that your biology is designed to win, not lose. And you've been indoctrinated to think that it's designed to lose. Three biological failures that underpin every single chronic disease you can name. Diabetes, check. Heart disease, check. Cancer, absolutely. Fatty liver, yep. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, dementia, Alzheimer's, neurodeeneration of any kind. Check. Check. Friaking check. Here they are. Like, this is how it works. Watch. Systemic inflammation. I will lay this I will I will lay this out. You can play it out and then we'll get into card reading. This is your immune system's thermostat stuck on max. Like as hot as it can get. You're on fire. Your white blood cells are treating your own tissue like it's a pathogen. Cytoines are flooding your bloodstream. IL6, TNF alpha, C reactive protein, and they're burning through your system like a forest fire that never ever stops. Look at insulin resistance. Your cells just they go deaf. They put ear muffs on and stop listening to insulin. It's not that you don't have enough insulin. So, when you guys look at your blood work, and a couple of you guys asked me, actually a lot of you guys asked me, can you teach us how to read labs? I can. It's going to be more than just a master class. I guess I can do it. But just understand when you see that insulin number, high is not good. That means your pancreas is freaking out because your cells aren't paying attention. They're insulin deaf. So, your cells put these headphones on and pretend insulin isn't talking. Your pancreas just keeps screaming louder and louder, pumping out more and more insulin, and nobody's home. Nobody's home knocking on the door. Nothing's there. Your muscles won't take glucose. Your liver is getting clogged and choked up with triglycerides. Fat stores are expanding. It is absolute metabolic chaos in your system. And look at the third one, the mitochondrial deficiency, the ATP shortage. ATP is cellular currency. It's the money that your body uses for every single transaction that you have. It's how your body does anything. Your mitochondria are underperforming to say the least. So hammering yourself with M C and SS31 thinking that's going to solve your mitochondrial issue is not the answer. if you don't understand human biology and think maybe there's a substrate problem, maybe there's a another signaling problem, maybe there's so many other things going on, there's a lot of moving parts. So, that's the issue that I see and I even hear it in my own group. People in my group go, "Hey, I heard your master class on this. I think I want to add that." No, you don't. No, you don't. Your biology is not ready for it. So, you need to solve your biological equation so you are running at 100% before you start adding in high performance things to make it run better. That's like taking your car, my 911 Turbo S, and it's running on five cylinders instead of six, and I start getting turbo upgrades and new downpipes and ECU flash and all the things that need to be done to make it faster. But I haven't even fixed the basic engine. That's the problem. Most solutions that you look out there address one of these problems, inflammation, insulin, or ATP. It does it at the same time, and it does it through one single biological mechanism. This is the stuff that makes me go, "Wow, this is so wild." Like big pharma doesn't want you to know this stuff and I'm giving it to you for free. Look, it's a it's a it's a selective PP delta agonist. 16 is what it's also known as. And no, again, it doesn't cause cancer. Before you guys go, oh, here we go. The biochemistry is going to get into again, but this is the beautiful part. Just follow me. PP ARS, okay? Peroxone proliferated activated receptors. They're these nuclear receptors. Just follow me. Just stick with me, please. their transcription factors. Basically, they're the boss that tells genes whether to turn on or turn off. You've got three, this is stuff that most people don't even tell you. You've got three main PPA subtypes, alpha, gamma, and delta. Okay, most of you have probably heard of, and you won't even know until I say it about in the fitness culture, they target PPA gamma, which are things like aandia, right? Okay. So things like that they improve insulin sensitivity absolutely but they come with a massive cost fat deposition weight gain massive cardiovascular stress. Carterine is different. It selectively activates PP AR delta only. And here's where the magic begins. So PP delta in your cells is the ultimate control system for metabolic fuel usage. Okay? Just follow me. So when you turn it on, you're essentially telling your body, hey, listen. We're going to switch from carbohydrate dependency to fat oxidation instead. So we're going to ramp up mitochondrial biogenesis in order to accomplish that. And we're going to also improve oxygen utilization. Oh, itchy. It's a metabolic switch, but not just any switch. It's this is the part that gets me so crazy when people go, I have to take this other thing. No, you don't. It's the switch that nature built inside your physiology specifically for survival during resource scarcity. If you've ever watched Alone or Survivor, they're running on this all day, baby. Your ancestors didn't have Mickey D's or Burger King or Arby's or Subway or Pizza Hut on every corner or Starbucks with their fat-free menu and the crap that still has 1,000 calories or 900 calorie coffees. When food ran out, PP AR Delta turned on and it told their bodies, "Hey, listen. Just so you know, we're burning fat right now. We're making more mitochondria and we're becoming way more efficient. You okay with that? I don't care. I'm going to do it anyway." Carterine essentially tells the modern body, yours, that it's supposed to be running on OPI fuel, like the most efficient fuel it's got. And your body listens. So, just follow me into the real physiology about this because this is where it's fascinating to me. When carterine binds to PPA or delta in your cells, a couple of things happen and they do this all simultaneously. First, mitochondrial biogenesis increases. So you there's a study 2004 by Drestle and he showed that PP delta activation increases the number and the function of mitochondria. So more mitochondria means more ATP production. Adenazine triphosphate the currency, right? You're literally creating more power plants to make more power to make you more efficient in your cells. It increases fatty acid oxidation. So your muscles and tissues start preferentially using fat, burning fat instead of glucose. They're called a highly oxidative phenotype. So your fibers shift towards slow twitch oxidative type composition. They actually change. That's how wild this stuff is. That was shown, by the way, 2004. Wang proved this. Your muscles become incredibly efficient. They use less glucose to do the same amount of work. Listen to what I just said. They use less glucose to do the same amount of work they're doing right now. So, it makes you imagine if you got more horsepower with less fuel, right? So, just follow me on that. Glucose uptake in muscles improves independent of insulin. Big deal. This is a huge deal. Your muscles become more insulin sensitive naturally because you're not overstimulating them with glucose. You're letting them rest metabolically while simultaneously improving their ability to handle all the fuel. Fatty acid transport into mitochondria improves. You know what controls this? And I talked about this before and it's on my post. CPT1, carnitine palm oil transferase 1. It's the gatekeeper that allows fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix where they can be burned. Cardine cranks this up. So now your fatty acids have a much better highway. No traffic, no rush hour, nothing into the mitochondrial furnace. Oxidative stress decreases. Now before you start contradicting this, I realize it sounds counterintuitive, right? Because you'd think that burning more fuel, right? So you start a fire. What do you create? Smoke. So, which is reactive oxygen species is how you have to look at smoke. That's at least how I look at it. You start a fire, it creates waste. And the waste are the things that punch holes in all your cells, your mitochondria, and make you less efficient, cause cancer and things like that. So, you'd think burning more fuel would create more oxidative stress. Agreed? But actually, efficient, this is cool, efficient fat oxidation creates less reactive oxygen species than inefficient glucose metabolism. So it goes back to more horsepower, less glucose. So your cells are working smarter, not harder. Your inflammatory pathways just quiet down big time. So if you remember the three problems, the three biological failures, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ATP shortage. So PP AR delta activation suppresses something called NFCappa B signaling. So NFCAPPA B is the master inflammation switch in your body outside of inflammosome, right? So less inflammation cascading through your system, less chance of disease. And when I say less chance, no chance. This is a cascade of events. It's not just a switch because every single one of these changes feeds the next one. So watch, you burn more fat efficiently. There's less oxidative stress. There's less inflammation. There's better insulin sensitivity, more ATP, better everything. It's not complicated, you guys. This is this is real physiology, right? So listen, it's a lot of people categorize this as an endurance compound. And this is where the narrative pretty much falls apart with Insta Bros. It's not just for runners or CrossFitters or whatever the hell it is you're doing because they people walk around go, "Oh yeah, that's that endurance compound helps with cardio." No. You know what that is? That's like looking at a Rembrandt and saying it's got some brown paint on it. That doesn't make sense. Endurance benefit. Listen, here's why. Well, it cranks up your endurance, but its endurance benefit is the symptom of what you have to think in terms of consequence of action, right? So, this is the symptom. This is the consequence of what's actually happening in your biology metabolically, right? Excuse me. So, think about what an just break this down. Let's go let's go down the endurance pathway. Okay? So, follow me. If look at what an endurance athlete is, what makes them have high endurance? someone who can sustain effort over a long time without fatigue accumulation. Why does that happen? Because their cells are producing ATP more efficiently because they're not accumulating lactate because their mitochondrial density is packed insanely high. But that very same mechanism, efficient energy production is exactly what you need to reverse fatty fatty liver disease, to restore insulin sensitivity and diabetics to reduce inflammation and most autoimmune if not all autoimmune conditions actually improve cardiovascular function optimize immune cell function to repair your gastrointestinal barrier integrity. I talked about that in the IBS post yesterday. It's not a feature list. It's the same biological foundation expressed in all the different tissues that you've got. That's why you have to stop compartmentalizing your body and look at it as one giant functioning machine. It's not separate pieces. It's not. Watch. A type two diabetic needs better ATP production in their muscles and liver cells. Agreed? That's exactly what carterine delivers. Someone with an autoimmune dysfunction because they don't really believe in autoimmune diseases. And I that's your God didn't build you to attack yourself. It's a dysfunction. But it needs less oxidative stress and less NFCappa signaling. Same mechanism. Someone with a cardiovascular disease needs endothelial function improvement and reduced systemic inflammation. Same mechanism. The endurance stuff. It's what happens when you apply optimal fuel metabolism to the specific context of exercise. Here's what separates carterine from pretty much every other metabolic intervention I've ever seen. If you guys go, "Hey, Dr. Trevor, do you take carderine?" Abso freakingutely. 30 minutes before my kangaroo dies, before every workout for 30 days. Then I take 30 days off. It's not hard. Listen, most look at most interventions. They're trying to compensate for broken metabolism, right? Broken biology. Metformin, it's trying to reduce glucose production and improve insulin sensitivity. You're fighting against an underlying problem. It never solves the problem. That's where if you listen to my FDA podcast, my my big pharma wants you dead podcast, it'll I explain all this with nothing but facts. Baby, look at GLP-1 agonists. They're telling your pancreas to produce more insulin and slowing gastric emptying. Okay, great. But you're not solving the underlying problem. It's a pharmaceutical band-aid. Things like a vandia forcing PP gamma activation, which helps. I'd said fully admit helps insulin sensitivity, but causes these catastrophic cardiovascular problems, weight gain. Are you out of your mind? It's actually causing more. It's making you acquire more disease, which follows the managed decline model. Carterine does something different. It's not fighting your metabolism. It's optimizing what's already supposed to be there and it's making it function the way it's designed. PP delta activation is part of your survival machinery. It's not foreign. It's not some drug that comes in like a wrecking ball and forces your biology to do something that it's not willing. It doesn't want to do unless it's forced. It's not compensatory. It's handing your body something it's supposed to have and supposed to do. And that's just the first reason it's effective. This the second one. It addresses the root cause. It doesn't address symptoms. So watch. You've got fatty liver. The root cause is mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a fatty acid accumulation and lipid peroxidation. Narine fixes that by improving mitochondrial efficiency and fatty acid oxidation. 2010 Evans showed that in a study. You've got diabetes. Let's keep going. The root cause is mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic beta cells and muscle and liver insulin resistance problems. Carterine fixes that by improving ATP production and metabolic flexibility. What about cardiovascular disease? Let's just go down this road because everybody's got so bad. Everybody's dying of it. No, you're choosing to die of it. I'll just leave that alone right now. But the root cause is endothelial, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Check. Check. Carterine handles all three of those. Every other drug is trying to manage the consequences. Please listen to me. Trying to manage the consequences of a broken engine. Arterine is fixing the engine. That's why it's so effective because you're not fighting your physiology. You're spooling it up to run at 100% instead of 12% like it's running right now. Listen, let me give you the framework of why cardine is this ultimate key to metabolic control. Your metabolism is actually controlled by a couple of critical decision points. Your body is constantly asking itself, should I use glucose or should I use fat? Should I be in storage mode or should I be in burning mode? Should I be inflammatory? Should I be anti-inflammatory? These decisions happen at the level of gene expression, specifically nuclear receptors like PPs. Big surprise, right? So, when you activate PP delta, you're centralizing control. That's what you're doing. You're telling multiple systems optimized for efficient energy production. Full stop. But here's what cascades from that single decision, the single biological decision. Watch. So in your muscle increase mitochondrial capacity, increase fat oxidation, improve glucose uptake, reduce lactate accumulation, shift fiber composition towards oxidative. 2007 Wang proved PP or delta activation. Literally rewired muscle tissue. And look at the liver. Increases fatty acid oxidation. Decreases VLDLDL production. Improves insulin signaling. Reduces apatic triglyceride accumulation. Luke 2008 showed PP PP PP AR delta activation in liver cells reduced steattosis. So steattosis is fatty liver. It's fancy word but it does this by upre up upregulating the genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation. So do you understand? We're not trying to scrape out the liver. We're trying to make the liver work the right way. So that doesn't even happen in the first place. Look at your atapost tissue. It improves mitochondrial function in atapost tissue your fat cells. Increases energy expenditure. reduces inflammatory cytoine production from fat tissue. Remember, this fat is metabolically active and it's just puking out inflammatory cytoines. It's not good for you. But it actually makes fat cells healthier, not just smaller. So, the ones that you have are functioning the way they're designed. They're supposed to be a storage unit, not an inflammatory unit, not a biological terrorist. Look at immune cells. It reduces pro-inflammatory state in your immune system. Proves T-reg. So, T-reg are the peacekeepers of your immune system. They say, "Hey, relax. You don't need to go nuts right now. You need to have these functioning perfectly otherwise you run into all kinds of other problems. It improves T- regulatory cell function. 2009 Pollock showed PP AR delta activation modulated immune responses by shifting towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Look at endothelial cells. Okay, inside of all your muscles improves vasoddilation increases nitric acid or nitric oxide production. Nitric acid that would be a bad thing. Nitric oxide production reduces oxidative stress. Improves blood flow. Improves oxygen delivery. You act and look at all of this because you activate one receptor, but the cascade fixes everything downstream. I need to drink some more water. But listen, when you fix upstream, everything gets solved. When you fix downstream, one thing gets solved and it creates 10 more problems. That's the difference. I'll probably drink that whole thing before this podcast is over. I'm like a freaking camel. Got a big hump. Dowaggers hump. The downstream effect of an upstream repair is not a side effect. That's its organization. This is a metabolic control because it's not management. It's optimization. It's calibration of your fundamental operating system. Okay, so you remember those three biological failures, right? Again, where's my Nobel Prize? You bet your ass I'm serious. Again, I'll show you how cardine I could do this with so many things. You can't do this with a drug. So, here I'll show you how solves all three. And no, they don't solve all three. Listen, I have to say this cuz somebody, well, didn't you say that about BPC57? Yeah, you have to start putting these together biologically so they solve your specific problem by solving the problem in where those three failures are. Where's the inflammation? Where's the insulin resistance? Where's the ATP problem? But when you solve them generically, usually the rest of the system self-resolves anyway. So look at system. Yeah, I didn't know that. Did you? Look at systemic inflammation. Just follow me. Carterine reduces inflammation through PP through remember the PP delta agonism suppresses NFCappa B. That's the master inflammatory signal, right? When it's off, inflammation gets turned off. The inflammatory genes stay off. You get less TNF alpha, less IL6, less IL1 beta, less C reactive CRP, C reactive proteins. If you're ever looking at your blood, 2006 Drestle measured this directly in your atapost tissue. Second, by improving mitochondrial function, you reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. ROS, reactive oxygen species, is the key trigger for inflammosomes. the NLRP3 inflammosome, which is the thing that turns this whole conflration on in your biology. So now less ROS means less activated inflammosomes, which means less caspase 1 activation, which means less IL1 beta and IL18 release. This is why it works so well. But look at how it improves metabolic flexibility and reduces the glucose overload. Okay, with all this nonsense diet that everybody has in the sedentary lifestyle, you reduce A formation, advanced glycation end products which stimulate rage receptors. Okay, these are the inflammatory signals. They bind rage receptors and perpetuate inflammation. You're drying up their fuel source so they can't work. Systemic inflammation gone. That's just one of the three biological failures. Look at insulin resistance. Okay, this is a two-part solution. This is really important to pay attention. So if you're going to pay attention to anything, this is the part you want to listen to. Part one. Okay. Direct improvement of glucose disposal. Huge. Carterine increases glute 4 transllocation to the cell membrane and muscle cells. Remember they come outside or come out to the cell membrane and then say give me glucose. And it does this though independent of insulin signaling. So you get glucose uptake without needing nearly as much insulin. Huge deal. By the way, the second part of this is you res you reduce the lipotoxicity that's causing the insulin resistance in the first place. Remember insulin resistance is often caused by excessive intracellular triglycerides and fatty fattyasal COA and fatty fattyasal COA accumulation. This activates PKC which phosphorolates IRS1 and blocks insulin signaling. Carterine fixes this by increasing fatty acid oxidation instead of accumulation. So go back to the IRS1, right? When this functions properly, insulin functions properly. Without it, nothing. This is why carterine is such a bear. 2010 Lee showed that PPR delta activation significantly improved insulin sensitivity. Even when fed highfat diet, the insulin resistance didn't develop in the first place because the fat was being oxidized. It wasn't being stored. That's why this stuff's so great. Oh, by the way, you guys are about ready to go, "Yeah, but I don't like needles. It's oral." No, it's not a peptide. Before somebody goes, "I thought you said oral peptides are bad." I did. They're all garbage. I don't care what you coat them in, what you rub them in, and how you roll them around in your tongue or shove them underneath your tongue. Sublingual doesn't work, intraasal doesn't work, oral doesn't work. Subq, period. By the way, subq versus IM. IM is it gets dispersed so much faster. What are you doing? Subq. That's just stop trying to listen to these Insta bros that are trying to be cute with the next trendy thing cuz they want to sound smart. If they were so smart, they'd actually be seeing patients and solving their problems, not just talking about it on social media with some followers and some hearts. So, you've just resolved the insulin resistance. Yeah, I'm in one of those moods today. Look at the ATP problem. Okay, the mitochondrial dysfunction. It's the most direct solution of all. It solves most of the problems in your body. When you have enough ATP, you can repair yourself. Your biologically is inherently repairative. It doesn't want to be broken. You're not designed to be broken. Look, carterine increases mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC1 alpha upregulation. So you're creating more mitochondrial machinery, more etc electron transport chain components, more ATP synthes, the turbine that spins right with a proton gradients that there's complexes 1 through 4 and then complex 5 ATP synthes. So it just that's where cytochrome C which is the end part of this entire system that turns out ATP for you more capacity to produce ATP. And now at the same time you're improving fatty acid oxidation which then yields more ATP per molecule than glucose oxidation. So you're using the most efficient fuel. Your ATP production capacity skyrockets and your ATP this is the important part your ATP production per unit substrate increases. So per you could use anything per milligram it's creating more horsepower. This is how you have to look at your biology. And once you actually understand this, biology becomes very easy. You're literally producing more cellular energy in your machine. ATP shortage solved, baby. Three fundamental failures, one simple solution. That's the power of understanding your root physiology. Look at I'll show you how this works in tissues if you really want to know cuz this is where the rubber meets the road, right? Look at fatty liver disease, right? Steattosis. Your liver is choking on triglycerides. Why? Because fatty acids are being packaged into VLDLDL and exported or they're being rehistersterified into triglycerides and stored, the mitochondria can't oxidize them fast enough. So now here's what carterine does. It walks in, punches it in the face, turns on hippatic acid oxidation or turns on hypatic fatty acid oxidation. So you're telling liver cells, burn this fat, stop storing it, knock it off. 2010 Evans showed PP delta activation reduced to paddics steattosis 70% with existing by the way existing so for all of you guys listening you might want to pay attention to this existing fatty liver disease human trials Roth showed even more human trials so just so you know all these people going around like Louisa she can bite me what a knucklehead going against peptides can't stand her here's the deal because she's a hypocrite she's a pharmaceutical bot hypocrite I'm going to solve Alzheimer's. No, you're not. You're never going to do it. You're going to solve selling your book and patting your bank account, you hypocritical [ __ ] [ __ ] You're never going to solve it because you're a liar. You are doing this for money. You're not doing this for the betterment of mankind. You can smell it from a mile away. And people are spoonfeeding themselves with all your lies. It's unbelievable. It bothers me a lot. Above all, do no harm. But yet, people like that above look at Adia. I can't even get into the politics of this because it makes me so crazy. Let me drink some water. Human trials 2012, it's 2026. That's 14 years ago. People showed even greater improvements. 80%. 80% reversal of cytosis. But there's no studies, right? Roth 2012. Look it up yourself. That's why I get aggravated when I see these people quoting studies and they have no business doing it because they're not quoting the other side of the equation. Listen, the mechanism for this is upregulation of carnitine palmato transferase, upregulation of CP2, improvements of the entire fatty acid oxidation pathway. You're not preventing fat from entering the liver, you're making the liver burn it. That's the difference. So, do you see now when you start doing things, it's like when you're preventing your liver from creating cholesterol, that's a big friaking problem. That's how drugs work. Now, do you see the problem? Now, do you see why this is a solution? Look at type two diabetes. We could do this all day, baby. Your muscle cells have stopped listening to glucose. Your liver is making too much. Your pancreas is burned out, exhausted. Carterine hits all three, right? Muscle, liver, pancreas. Improved muscle glucose uptake through glute 4 expression and mitochondrial efficiency. I've already talked about this. Reduced apatic glucose output because it's there's improved fuel switching. Improved pancreatic beta cell mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress. They produce insulin more efficiently. 2004 loots proved this. PP delta activation improved glucose tolerance. 2013 Tanaka showed improved HBA1C and type 2 diabetes. How about but there's no studies, right? There's no studies for any of these things, right? No studies for any of these research compounds. My eye I already laid it out for you guys to play it out exactly why that exists and why the largest funding source for research studies are the pharmaceutical companies that bury the negative results. This isn't managing a disease. It's fixing the physiology underneath. Let's do cardiovascular disease since everybody freaks out about that. Your endothelium is dysfunctional. Oxidative stress is through the roof. Atherosclerosis is choking out your vascular system. Carterine improves endothelial function through increased mitochondrial function in endothelial cells which means increased ATP availability for sodium potassium ATPAS which means maintaining resting membrane potential in vasoddilation. Improved fatty acid oxidation means less oxidative stress in the endothelium itself. So it can actually function because it is a living breathing part of your body. Enos so many things. These 6,000 miles of vascule in your body is required. By the way, God didn't make it just for you to have veiny forearms and shoulder veins or a trap vein like some bodybuilder. PP or delta activation also increases nitric oxide. It does it through the ENOS upregulation. So this is why I'm trying to explain this to you. 2007 Pollock showed all of this so clearly. A third grader could understand this. Less oxidative stress, better vasoddilation, improved blood flow, reduced atheroscllerotic risk. But how many examples do there need to be before you understand that the system out there, the medical industrial complex doesn't want you healthy, they want you sick and subdued. So you have to rely on them to survive under their expert toutelage of be how to become healthy. Despite the fact that the food pyramid is built for spases by spases designed to keep you sick. Listen, when you see a system that decides to ban seeds during a quote unquote pandemic, red flags should go up. Bells should go off. Look at your immune system. Immune cells are overactive and producing pro-inflammatory cytoines when there's an immune issue. Carterine doesn't suppress your immune system whatsoever. That would be counterproductive, right? That wouldn't work. Instead, it improves metabolic efficiency in your immune cells. T- cells have different metabolic requirements depending on their activation state. Right? So PP air delta activation shifts towards a more quant less inflammatory phenotype but it's doing it while maintaining immune competency. Right? The surveillance it's looking around it's maintaining all of that. 2009 Pollock this guy's great study was elegant on this. Showed PP delta activation promoted IL10 production. That's the anti-inflammatory cytoine by the way. And it reduced pro-inflammatory responses. TNF alpha, IL6, IL1 beta. Your immune system still works. It's just not constantly at rage with everything. It's not lit up and hypervigilant. That's the problem. Look at your GI system. Yeah, these are all things that people What? I didn't know it did this. It's so remember what I said, three biological failures. This is why I'm trying to explain this stuff to you. Your gut, your gut barrier is permeable. Your intestinal epithelial cells are inflamed and dysfunctional. So, intestinal epithelial cells are metabolically very demanding. Remember I told you every 3 to 5 days that entire lining is changed over and they're ATP demanding. They need constant ATP for tight junction maintenance, active nutrient transports and barrier function. Their energy starved and what do you think happens to that barrier? It tanks. Arterine improves epithelial ATP production. It reduces local inflammation. It improves blood flow to your gut. 2011 Varga showed PP AR delta activation improved barrier integrity. So you're not just healing the gut, you guys. You're giving it the metabolic resources so it can heal itself. If you're taking this for endurance, because somebody's going to ask me, so I'm going to try and preemptively answer these questions. V2 max ability to sustain effort longer. I know people that have just gone, dude, I could run for days on this stuff. Let me explain what's actually happening so you get it. Their mitochondria are more numerous. Their fatty acid oxidation capacity is higher. They're producing more ATP per mitochondrion per power plant. their lactate threshold is higher because lactate is only produced when pyuvate production exceeds mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Excuse me. You make more mitochondria. You produce more ATP before lactate accumulates. It's that simple. It's a higher lactate threshold. That's what gives you your better endurance. By the way, wrestle in 2006 measured V2 V2 max, which people say can't change. My eye absolutely sure can. V2 maxing measured it directly. BPA or delta activation increased V2 max by 50%. 50. If your endurance went up 50%, what could you do? That's not a small effect. That's a difference between sedentary and very elite training. This is a part I almost don't want to say this. Maybe I shouldn't. I just I really don't. You don't even have to exercise for this to work. I just I hate saying that cuz then people go, "Wait, I can just take these drops and just sit on my couch?" Yeah. Yeah, you can. You're missing the point because everything else is going to fall apart. But yes, you can. And I'd be a liar if I said otherwise. And I just refuse to do that. So the endurance improvement comes at the same from the same mitochondrial and metabolic optimization that heals disease, reduces inflammation, and improves insulin sensitivity. It's still going to show up. They're not separate effects. Endurance is what what metabolism looks like applied to exercise when it's functioning at capacity. Someone with incredible mitochondrial function, low systemic inflammation, and perfect insulin sensitivity is going to have excellent endurance. Of course, why why wouldn't they? It's not a side effect. That's the natural expression of a healthy metabolic rate, right? That's it. Listen, I wasn't going to talk about this part because it always gets people all wired up. But the cancer thing, this is what separates me as a leader and you as a listener becoming a leader and all the other people spouting marketing nonsense. There were studies in rats suggesting carterine was carcinogenic. Ballistar 2003 studies in 2007. Kayazu did it showing bladder. There's more, but these are the two most recent ones showing bladder cancer in rats at extremely high doses. Here's what you need to understand about this. Okay, first the doses. They were absurdly high. Absurdly high. Like we're talking minimum 100x times what would be used therapeutically. When you dose anything at 100x normal levels, you get abnormal results, dumbass. Now, the root of exposure matters, too. They gave carterine as subcutaneous implants. That's a different exposure pattern than oral administration. And here's the biggest part about this. The mechanism they proposed doesn't hold up to any scrutiny whatsoever. Watch. So, this is what they suggested. Just so you know, they suggested carterine causes cancer through SIP activation and DNA damage. But here's the thing. All subsequent research shows that PPR delta activation actually reduces DNA damage risk through improved mitochondrial function and reduced reactive oxygen species. So 2009 and the subsequent 2010 2013 years in a row by the way human safety studies showed zero carcinogenic signaling, zero increased cancer incidents, zero genetic damage markers. Do you guys know what zero means? It it doesn't cause it. Here's what's actually happening. Okay. At extremely high doses in rodents that were genetically designed to have cancer. By the way, you get tissue damage from metabolic stress. That tissue damage triggers inflammation inflam inflammation which can even then these are rats that were designed to have cancer. Genetically designed to have cancer. So the inflammation can drive tumor formation. It's not a PP delta mechanism. It's a toxicity mechanism. That's like saying water causes cancer. Because if you force feed rats at 200 L of water in one day and its organs fail, but probably the water that caused the damage, relevant human data, zero cancer risk. In fact, PP delta activation is protective against some cancers. Do you know why? Improves mitochondrial function, reduces ROS, reactive oxygen species, reduces chronic inflammation, which is a cancer driver, and improves immune function and surveillance and natural killer cells, which polices cancer cells. The narrative that carterine causes cancer isn't supported by any research. It's based on a misinterpretation of rodent toxicity studies at violently extreme doses. They're not the same. Listen, here's the framework and why this is pretty much the master key for your metabolism. Every chronic disease shares a common pathway. Metabolic dysfunction, mitochondrial failure, energy deficit, and then the compensatory inflammation that comes following that. Your body tries to fix an energy deficit by activating inflammatory pathways. Inflammation is actually a survival mechanism. Yes, it really is. When you're starving metabolically, inflammation increases glucose production and mobilizes stored energy. But, but I got to put the butt in here. When that becomes chronic, inflammation becomes violently destructive. Every intervention for chronic disease is trying to interrupt this cascade somewhere. Watch. I'll prove it. Anti-inflammatory drugs try to suppress the inflammation, but you lose the survival mechanism. Insulin drugs try to force glucose disposal, but you're not fixing the underlying energy problem or the resistance itself. Lifestyle interventions try to fix behavior, but they're indirect and very seldomly followed. Carterine does something completely different. It fixes the energy deficit itself. No, I'm not saying you should sit on your couch. That's why I started laughing when I said it. When your mitochondria are producing adequate ATP, your body doesn't need to activate emergency inflammation. Agreed? So, your immune system doesn't need to be in high alert. Your metabolism can be calm, efficient, and self-regulating the way it's designed by God. That's not management. That's called a cure. Because if you're, this is why you're fixing the metabolic foundation. When you fix your metabolic foundation, everything gets better. Watch. Here's what happens. Your cardiovascular system gets better because endothelial cells aren't stressed. Your immune system gets better because immune cells aren't metabolically desperate. Your brain gets better because neurons get the energy they need and there's no neuroinflammation. Your joints get better, right? Because connective tissue isn't inflamed, so it's not degrading. your skin gets better because caratinosytes aren't stressed out. It's not that carterine is magic, which is I think what a lot of you guys are looking for. What's this next magic thing that I can take? Because this little social media machine here, tapping my phone for everybody listening to this, has people fooled thinking the next thing is actually the next thing, but it never is. It's that metabolic health is the foundation of all health. When you fix the foundation, everything built on top of it downstream improves. Carterine rules metabolic everything because it rules metabolism itself. It's the key that fits into the lock and it fixes the lock. So, do you understand why now that makes sense? Here's what you need to understand and I really want you to hear this. Your body isn't broken. It's not failing you. It's just given the wrong set of instructions and it's being given the wrong set of instructions usually by people that don't know what they're talking about or corporations that want to make sure it doesn't get the right signaling because it makes them more money. You're overloaded with glucose. You're stressed with chronic inflammation. You've asked it to run on insufficient energy. Carterine is you finally handing your body the manual it should have had right from day one. It's not a crutch or a band-aid or some kind of compensation. It's optimization and capitalization of your system. It's the difference between managing a disease and transcending it. That's why I'm trying to explain this today. Your physiology doesn't lie. And there's tons of data to support this. When you give your mitochondria what they need, when you optimize fuel metabolism, when you reduce the inflammatory burden on your system, every single thing you've got works better. You work better because you're finally working with your biology instead of against it like a wrecking ball. That's not theory. It's chemistry, physics, biochemistry. It's proven. It's documented everywhere. It's studied human biology. And now the best part about this entire thing is that like I I don't come out here for me. I read all these books and I've done this with patients for 30 years. I want you to have the information so you know what to do with it. Anyway, I hope you get something out of this. I'm going to go inside and hang out. Never miss.
