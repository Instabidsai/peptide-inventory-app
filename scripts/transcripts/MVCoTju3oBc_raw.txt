What are we 5 days in? 26. I think maybe you guys aren't. Maybe you guys just aren't tired of being lied to by Reddit and Kora and the shills on social media, even the docs or the guys like Brea or Listen, I just really struggle. I don't, like I said, I don't come out here to give you any. I'm going to talk about all the mistakes that are costing everybody that's using Reddit truth hide. Everything you're doing to screw it up to make it not work. So, you blame the peptide and not the biology. And I'll tell you how to solve the problem, too, and explain really the dominoes that this peptide knocks over in disease and how it weight loss is. It has nothing to it's an accessory to this peptide. Like, you guys are being lied to. You guys are being lied to with this thing, this social media machine. That's my wife. Look at her. She's so beautiful. I just stare at my wife all the time because I adore I know it has nothing to do with this podcast. I don't care. She's my best friend. I adore my wife. You guys are being lied to and I'm trying to give you the answers so you can just make an informed decision. I talked to one of my really good friends today. His name is Heath. He's a attorney of mine and love the guy to death. He's just a great dude. And even he says that to me when I'm asking him advice. He says, "I'm going to give you the information and then I'm going to take off my attorney hat. I'm going to give you my friend advice and I'm going to put the hat back on. I'm going to give you my attorney advice. I want you to be able to make an informed decision." That's what I'm doing with you guys. I come out here and I give you the information and I put on my doctor's hat. Believe I went to med school and chiropractic college. Okay? I'm not Somebody said I was a physical therapist. Listen, I think physical therapists are badass. If you're a physical therapist, you are just as qualified. Do you understand that? I know guys that are like like my buddy Travis Ortmeer or Donnie Thompson. They're intelligent. They don't have MD or DC or PhD after their name, but they know more than I'll say 98 99% of the doctors out there. Do you guys really think that the letters after somebody's name denotes expertise? That's the problem. I had somebody say, "Isn't this guy just a PT? He's not even remotely qualified to give advice." I've forgotten more than most people will ever learn. And it's not to brag. It's because I genuinely give a crap about you. None of you guys are going to do what I had to do, which was when I was a kid, I had to get something called a bus ticket or drop change into a clear tube with a driver would watch go down then and he'd rip off something called a bus pass or a transfer rather where I could go to take more than one bus. I had a time on it and it was ripped off diagonally to match the time to a library to spend all day at a library. You guys don't have any of that to worry about. I had to look at actual books. My library in my house is gigantic. There are so many books and I read all the time because I want to give you guys the information. I want to keep my brain working. Those are the mental reps I have to do. You guys have this thing, this cell phone that allows you to get information and most of you guys lose it to or use it to be a victim or to tear other people apart. I realize this isn't a psychology podcast. It's just a health podcast. to health is nothing happens in the mind without it happening in the body. You guys need to do better. Like I'm going to explain everything from A to Z on Reddit of True Tide. I'm still going to get hate in my comments. I don't understand. You guys need to grow up. You guys listen to bodybuilders with trap veins and no neck and they can't get their wallet out of their back pocket or somebody that claims to be an expert that has no business being an expert because they've really never seen a patient. I've seen over a million patients in real life. You can look up all my clinics. They're real clinics. I've seen real patients and I still see real patients, real clients, real people because I care. I'm going to do this and I thought I was out of the healthcare game. I really did cuz I didn't like it. I didn't like having somebody's thumb on my head telling me what I can and can't do. And then I realized, you know what the hell with you? I'm going to tell everybody what they need to know so they can have the best biology ever and the best life ever so they can live their best life. I don't care if there's a license involved. I don't care what degrees I have. I care that you're getting the information so you can make an informed decision. But you guys have to learn to understand that the information has to come from a credible source. If you don't think I'm a credible source by now, you're never going to believe anything I say, which is insane because I know a lot. Like, nobody knows biology as well as I do. Nobody knows physiology or biochemistry as well as I do. And it's not an arrogant statement. It's the fact that I actually make myself useful to you. I think the strongest predictor of a strong, healthy, powerful, successful life is a purpose. This is my purpose. It's to give you guys everything. Doctor doesn't mean arrogant jackass in a white coat with a god complex. I say it all the time. It means a guy that goes out and teaches. And in order to teach, you have to learn. My best teacher, one of my best neurology teachers, Dr. Murphy, Dr. Dan Murphy. This guy was so smart. He would spit out lines from books, tell you what page everything. He was so intelligent. And I remember the way he explained the spinal cord and like lateral spinalic tract, the brain, the compartments of the brain, the way the areas of the like brocas, warnicks, all these areas of the brain, all these things, he made it so easy to understand. And what I learned from that man was that when you know it so well that you can explain it to a third grader, you know your stuff. And that always stuck with me. So I try and give you the information. Yeah, I use big fancy words. I don't use kindergarten language because I want you to understand the terms because when somebody else says it and you don't know what it is, you're screwed. You're screwed. So, I give you the real information and the real facts and the real research. So, you have you decide what you do with it. But, I'm out here to help you. Like I said, join the black card. Awesome. You guys have I told you that you have the extension to still get in at 9,997 bucks for the year. If you don't understand how ridiculously inexpensive it is to get direct access to the Q&A that I run every Monday evening today where I just solve problems, I don't care what health issue you have. I'll solve it. In fact, I don't care what business issue you have. I'll solve it. And if not, I have access to people that'll help me solve it so I can come and solve it for you. I can ask my friends, even if I have to pay them. Bedros, Dan Martell, Brad Lee, these are all people that are really good friends of mine that if I don't know, I will gladly pay them to find out the answer and then pass it on to you. Why? because I trust them. They've never let me down. And if you trust me, then that means I can't ever let you down. So, I'm not going to. But the health, I'm going to give you all I got. These people all trust me with their health. You realize they could choose anybody, right? But they choose me. There's a reason for that. There's a reason why Dwayne Johnson messages me, not for any other reason. He could choose anybody, but he asks me. This is because I actually give value. I'm trying to do the same thing for you. So, if you guys get in my comments and drop, "Hey, I don't know what to tell you. You're stupid. You're broken psychologically. You're too busy defending your position instead of going, "Wow, this actually makes sense. This guy cares." Like, you're being lied to. Your doctor's lying to the pharmaceutical companies are lying to you. And worst of all, I think a lot of you guys are lying to yourselves. I'll give you all I got about Reddit truth tide. Yet again, I could probably run a minieries for a month on Reddit True Tide, and it still wouldn't be enough. I'm going to do another Reddit True Tide post at some point this week about why low carbs and Reddit True Tide terrible marriage. I'm not going to get into that. No, maybe I'll talk about We'll see. But you guys want a magic bullet for obesity and disease? You want to pop a peptide and wake up healthy? Okay, fine. Here's the truth about radatride. It will either be the most powerful tool that you will ever use or the most expensive lesson you ever learn. Those are the only two options. The difference between those two outcomes has nothing to do with the peptide and everything to do with the 9 in between your ears, the gray matter, the thing that's soaking up all your ATP right now trying to figure out what I'm trying to say. This isn't some gentle chat. It's a guy that's out here going, "I'll be your dad and your doctor all at the same time." This is like a biological reckoning for you guys. I'll tell you exactly why Reddit True Tide fails and how every single one of those failures points directly back at your own actions or inactions. This is not some fancy little podcast. It's a here's the information. Now, let's get to it's like an intervention, right? It's like an except that was a dumb show, wasn't it? Look it. The first failure, the nonresponder. The term non-responder is a garbage term invented by a lazy clinician who tried to explain away their therapeutic failures. The patient isn't a nonresponder. The patient is a walking talking monument to metabolic dysfunction. So profound that it creates this biological force field against the intervention. Read a true tight is a key. Your body is a lock. And if the lock is welded shut, I hate to tell you there's no key in the world that's going to turn it ever. And that's how you have to look at this. There are three, four, probably five at the most failures saboturs that will guarantee reatrides failure. Mitochondrial apocalypse is the first one. Read a true tide. I said this in my podcast or in my Instagram post. It's the crown jewel is glucagon agonism, right? Glucagon receptor agonism. Glucagon's metabolic command is very simple. It's crank up energy expenditure, burn all the fat, get to work, do all the stuff you're designed to do. But this command is issued to your mitochondria, which are the tiny little power plants inside your cells. So, what if those power plants are disastrous, tired, broken down, rusty, full of holes machinery that's belching out, blue smoke on the freeway, barely running on two cylinders out of all eight. That's how you have to look at it, right? So, 2018, cell metabolism, the study was unequivocal. Mitochondrial dysfunction directly impairs the cellular response to glucagon-l like signaling. Listen to what I just said. The signaling pathway is intact. Okay, the peptide does its job. The peptide binds to the receptor. The message is sent, but the cellular machinery is far too damaged to execute the order. It's like having perfect internet connection to a computer that's like a Commodore 64 and you're on fiber. If you know what a Commodore 64 is, you know what I'm talking about. How about just a computer with a fried mother? The signal arrives, but nothing happens. It's like those old computers when I was in elementary school. We had tape drives. I kid you not, before a floppy. This isn't a peptide failure, you guys. It's not. This is the consequence of decades of processed food and chronic stress, sedentary living, and stupid decisions. You have systematically destroyed your cellular infrastructure. The 24% weight loss reported in 2003 New England Journal of Medicine, the Triumph trial, right? That's for people with functional mitochondria. Eli Liy isn't going to tell you that. They're going to say, "Give me $1,200 for a vial." And then they're going to promise you the world. Then you're going to have all kinds of infomercials with people that are incredibly obese who have gotten slightly less obese and say it worked really well for them. They lost six pounds in a month. You can do the old school HCG diet where you eat 500 calories a day and say take HCG drops all bunk and you'll lose more than that. You'll just look like a melted candle or a bag of water. What I'm trying to tell you is those aren't magic and they're going to fill those things with all kinds of garbage. I wouldn't trust them as far as I could throw them. But the 24% fat loss you need functional mitochondria for for you. A lot of you guys with your metabolic junkyard, you're going to be lucky to see 2 3 4%. The problem isn't the peptide, you guys. The problem is the corpse that you're trying to put it into. You're trying to inject it into something that will not accept the signal because it doesn't work. The second one is the corticost the corticosteroid problem. It's like a category 5 hurricane that you guys are running in your biology. Predinazone, dexamethasone, cortisone, all the zones, right? These are legalized metabolic wrecking balls. They are prescribed to bludgeon inflammation to death, but their collateral damage is a systemic metabolic meltdown. 2020 review in the Journal of Metabolism laid out the mechanics with unbelievable clarity. Cortico, listen to me, corticosteroids induce severe rapid onset insulin resistance and dramatically increase hippatic gluconneogenesis. What that translates into is they make your entire body, every cell deaf to insulin while forcing your liver to pump out sugar like a factory with the lever smashed and jammed into the on full throttle position. So now you inject retatide and refresh my memory again everybody. What is the primary goal of reatride according to every lab out there? to improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose. So now you've just created I used this example in my Instagram post yesterday. You've just created the ultimate pharmacological stalemate. You're asking reatrus, right? To push a giant metabolic boulder up an inc like up Everest. You're going up K2. I realize they're different mountains. while a corticosteroid bulldozer from the biggest mine you've ever seen is shoving the rock back down twice as fast. This is a battle that reat cannot metabolically win. Endocrinologically it can't win. 2014 JAMA internal medicine study linked insulin therapy to worse outcomes. You know that one? I've talked about it before. Same principle applies here. You're adding fuel to a fire and wondering why the fire department doesn't show up. If you're on chronic corticosteroids of any kind, retatrite is a financial donation to in this case probably Eli Liy. It's not a therapeutic intervention. It's not going to help. And what they're going to do, follow me. If I was a shady, crooked son of a [ __ ] I would tell you it doesn't work and then I'd give you other things to solve all your other metabolic problems to get this to work. You just became a customer for life. And guess what else you're headed towards? Manage decline. You're welcome. You know what I don't try and do? Like I said, you want to buy from Elite Biogenics, do it. I will take as best care of you as I can. They don't come out of my house. I've got labs and warehouses. Like, I I have a giant company. It's because I care. But I'm not going to make you a managed decline customer. I don't want to do that. I know what it's like to be on that side of the equation. I hated it. I love you too much to do anything but tell you the truth and take it or leave it, however you want. This is because I care. Join the blackard. Apply at unlockthecard.com. Send Jen or Amber a message and they'll send you the wire transfer information. You send them 9,997 bucks if you make it before the end of the day and away you go. You get access to my live private Q&A call. You get the VIP community. You get my protocol library. You get access to me. The only step up from that is one-on-one with me personally where you get my cell phone number and that is $250,000 and it is still too cheap. And I have a slight waiting list. The way you get on the waiting list by the ways you pay. In case you're wondering, put me on the waiting list. You have to pay the full amount to get on the waiting list because I'm not putting anybody on a waiting list with a trust me bro. I'm not. I take 20 people a year. 20 people in 12 months I take as one-on-one clients. I won't take anymore because I actually want to be able to take care of you. It's not about the money. I don't need the money anymore. And people go, "You always, yeah, I do. I want more money." Of course. I also want better health and a better marriage and I have a fantastic marriage and I have great health. You should always be looking up. Aim up. But I digress. just understand why I'm out here. So, you decide what you want to do. I don't care. I'm still going to come out here. I'm two years in now. It's my second year and I'm still doing it. I didn't just test out the theory, dip my toe in the water. The next one after the corticosteroids, this one really bothers me. Is the dietary treason, the thermodynamic coup that you guys are playing on yourselves. This is the most ridiculous, [ __ ] stupid self-inflicted failure model that could possibly exist. Reddit true tide watch reduces appetite. It doesn't suspend the fundamental laws of physics. The first law of thermodynamics. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It's not a suggestion you guys. It is the law of the universe. It doesn't change just cuz you want it to. So red tide might give you 15% tops metabolic advantage by increasing energy expenditure. Right? But if you interpret its appetite suppression as this hall pass to have a 5,000 calorie cheat meal of a couple of Whoppers, heavy all extra mayo, all the fries you can stuff into your bark hole, make it poutine with gravy and cheese on it. Add some ice cream in and a whole bunch of soda because you've had a rough day and you deserve it from all the work you're putting in. You've you're committing an act of nutritional treason. You've just vaporized the drug's entire benefit in one single act of imbecillic stupidity in just in one sitting. Look at the participants in the 2023 triumph trial. They achieve that 24% fat loss. Fat loss by the way 70% of the weight they lost was fat. No other semiglutide tepatide not even close. Like they're single digits because they cause muscle catabolism. They demolish you and stop arguing to defend them and going well it worked better for me. If you are staring at the number of the on the scale and you're thinking that's the number that matters over your metabolic biological health, you've been conditioned to think stupid things. It's not the number. I am 200 lb and I know people that are 200 lb that look nothing like me. I know people that are 200 lb that make me look like I've never trained a day in my life. They're so jacked. And I know people that are 200 lb that are shaped like a circle. That number means nothing. Your composition means everything. And I'm 510 and a half, maybe 5'11 on a good day, maybe. And that's with some good shoes, Tom Cruz shoes. I don't care how tall I am. Doesn't matter. Can't change it. God built me this way for a reason. I'm supposed to be this height. But they achieved that 24% under controlled monitored conditions and with functional mitochondria. In the wild with dietary anarchy that's out there, those results are a fantasy because nobody's going to abide by that because you're going to go back to your nutritional idiocy. Redatrite is a very precise metabolic tool. It's not some magic force field against the thermodynamic reality of a cheeseburger. You can't outsource discipline to something that comes in a syringe. And so I'm trying to give you this information so you understand it. Listen, here's one of the biggest things that I see that are it's a problem. It's look at the staggering weight loss because you guys are missing the boat on Reddit truth tide and this is this for me. Personally, I think this is the secret reason why they're fighting so hard to get all the compoundingies to wipe it out and you're not allowed to sell it. You guys can all go to hell for that. What I think is the real reason is because it actually solves disease processes and they want to make sure it's impossible to get because it wrecks their model. The staggering weight loss is a side effect you guys. It's a glorious profitable side effect, but it's just a side effect nonetheless. And I realize I've said there's no such thing as side effects. There are only effects. It's just an ancillary to the whole thing. Redatide is not a weight loss drug. It is a multi- system metabolic conductor of your biology. It restores harmony to a very dism dysfunctional hormonal orchestra that's been playing nothing but static and shitty tunes for the last however long you've been alive. Here let me give you the unvarnished biochemistry of its mechanism so you actually understand. You have GLP I have to explain this and you guys might know you I know this already. You still need to understand it. GLP1 agonism. This is the appetite kill switch. This is it targets the brain stem and hypothalamus. Its message is primitive and very direct. Stop eating. That's it. It gives a very gentle glucose dependent nudge to the pancreas to secrete insulin. This is the part that everybody understands. That's so I have this uncle and an aunt Renie and Jenny. I kid you not, you can't make that up. My uncle Renie was first chair violinist in the orchestra in Winnipeg Symphony. And that was this is the first chair violinist. That's what this would be, right? The GLP one. GIP agonism is the mic in the amplifier. Glucose dependent insulinotropic polyeptide. It amplifies the signal from GL. It makes the satiety signal louder and independently improves slightly how the body handles fat and insulin, not massively. This is the second chair next to my uncle Ranny making the section sound full and then they both have microphones and now everybody can hear in the back of the auditorium, right? Glucagon. This is like you let this off the chain and this is what changes physiology. This is what changes disease. This is what makes dementia go hustila bye-bye. Glucagon agonism. This is such a gamecher. Please hear me out. This is the entire orchestra behind these two violins. For 50 years, endocrinology vilified glucagon because it raises blood sugar. This is a very catastrophic misreading. Glucagon's primary metabolic function is to force the liver to oxidize fatty acids. We know this, and if you don't, now you do. Transforms your liver from a passive fat storage warehouse, excuse me, into an active just fattor torching furnace. This action alone, by the way, dramatically increases basil metabolic rate. The number of calories you burn at rest is what that means. Before somebody says, I don't really know what that means. Yes, you do. And your trainer is trying to make it really complicated. You don't need it complicated. You just need a solution. The weight loss is the inevitable result of fixing the broken system. Redatai doesn't pull a tarp over the metabolic dumpster fire hoping it doesn't burn its way through. It shows up with a fleet of fire trucks and puts the fire out at its source so you don't have the problem anymore. This is why pairing redatruide with a strict low carb or ketogenic diet is a crazy. It doesn't make sense. Strategic error. It is a strategic error. Ketosis is a metabolic state characterized by low insulin and high reliance on fat oxidation. Right? We know this. Red tides glucagon action. Follow me. Just follow me. Stay with me on this one. It works optimally within a more complex hormonal milluly higher carbs. 2017 in diabetes demonstrated proved that the metabolic benefits of glucagon are maxed out in the presence of a mixed nutrient load with carbohydrates. So by severely restricting carbs or taking that entire orchestra I was talking about with Renie and you're reducing it to one note that they just play non-stop just this monotone for the whole time. You're effectively muting the complex conversation between insulin, glucagon, and all the other hormones that reertide is designed to conduct. It's built like this by the biochemical engineers. You might lose some weight, but you're leaving 60 70% of the peptides power, the systemic health restoring potential on the table. You're guys got to stop listening to these Reddit guys, man. Please, for you, not for me. I don't care. Post me on Reddit and complain about me. I don't care. I see all kinds of people. I hate this guy. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Hey, he's backwards. No, I'm not. You just don't like it because it goes against what you were taught by some knucklehead with abs. I'm a doctor with abs. Now what? You can argue with me all you want. You can't argue with biology. And I come out here to give you the straight biology. And if you go something, not everybody's the same. Biology is always the same. Physiology, biology always the same. Just is the way it is. Gravity isn't variable. Neither is your biology. When you correct, listen to me. This is I think you guys need to understand just how wild this peptide really is. It's red or true. It cures. It doesn't manage. I'm talking real diseases, you guys. When you correct the core metabolic insanity, the dominoes of chronic diseases, they just fall. Red or true tide doesn't manage any of the conditions I'll talk about. It systematically dismantles their foundational causes. Look at kidney disease. This is a big one. The fibrosis, kidney disease, all that stuff, right? Going on dialysis and thinking there's dial, there's a dialysis business. Let me explain that before you go. My grandpa's on dialysis. It's not a business. If grandpa would have been better taken care of and gotten better advice from a real doctor who actually cared about him and didn't shove medication down his pie hole or into his veins, he wouldn't need diialysis and he wouldn't need that business. Save it. I care more about grandpa than you. If you are justifying the dialysis that simple cuz I don't make any money off of it. I have no no vested interest in anything for grandpa other than grandpa's health. Maybe, just maybe, in 2026, you guys will shift that paradigm and realize that this guy here has no interest in anything other than your frigin health, your life, your future. A 100 years for you to smash goals and live the most kick-ass life on this plan. I'm not pushing my peptides or my black card. You join if you want, don't join. Look at the Alexa trial. Not Alexa, Alexa. 2015, New England Journal of Medicine. The trial on rea was it was a variation of rea was it's a wakeup call. It showed massive reduction in composite kidney outcomes. The leader trial 2016 same thing New England Journal of Medicine great source of information by the way confirmed it. The mechanics redue tide attacks kidney disease three friends. I'll go over them even just so you have them. Reduces glucco toxicity. It's the chronic high blood sugar that's poison to the delicate filters of the kidney. the glomemeriuli, right? The glomemeil is little tuft of vessels inside it. It by normalizing blood glucose, redatruide stops the sugar poisoning, lowers intglomeular pressure. So it reduces the pressure inside those same little filters because they're delicate, which is the primary driver of fibrosis, quells the systemic inflammation, the inflammatory cytoines that damage blood vessels throughout the body, destroy kidney tissue, it shuts it down. Read a true tide triple action does this more effective than any single or dual agent therapy on earth by orders of magnitude. It's not slowing the decline of your kidneys. It's creating an environment where they can actually recover and go back to functioning the way they are. Your body is designed to heal. Stop thinking it doesn't stop thinking you are sick or dying or hurting because you have a deficiency in a drug. You don't. You have a deficiency in knowledge because you're being fed information from people that don't give a crap about you and they want to put you on anything they possibly can. It's not the same. I'm not trying to put you on anything. If you're damaged, I want to put you on a bunch of peptides so they're sol so you solve the problem. Then get off. They're not forever things. There's a certain number of them that are, but they're not designed forever. They're signals. They're not drugs. And that's just the kidneys. Look at insulin sensitivity and pancreatic health. The one the phase 2 trials 2023, the Lancet. This is the freaking masterpiece. This is one of my favorite research papers. The headline focused on A1C reduction, but the real story was buried in the homatu IR data. That's the measure of insulin resistance. The real measure of insulin resistance. The trial showed beyond dramatic improvements. This is critical. Please listen to me. Listen to what I'm saying. Red True Tide doesn't just whip an exhausted pancreas, the beta cells to produce more insulin, which is catastrophic. It makes the liver, the muscles, and the fat cells sensitive to insulin. Again, let me I'll even explain how. It does this by clearing out the intracellular garbage that jams up the insulin signal. Specifically, lipid metabolites like dasoggly glycerols, dags, ceramides, things like that. 2018 paper cell metabolism showed that these lipids activate enzymes that directly block the insulin receptor. Watch reducides glucagon semiglute the semi semiglutide and tepathide do not have this which is why they fail. Stop defending them. Redatrides glucagon-driven fat burning metabolism cleans out all of this garbage out of the cellular lock lubs it up and gets it working again. Look at the brain. Alzheimer's, dementia, type three diabetes. The concept of Alzheimer's as type 3 diabetes, by the way, is not controversial anymore. It is an established science and you can find thousands of studies proving it. The brain becomes insulin resistant. Neurons starve for fuel and then they die. The amaloid plaques, the tow tangles, tombstones, they're not the cause. That's the scar tissue that's left over. The funeral wreaths left after the neurons have starved to death from the insulin resistance. 2018 metaanalysis in frontiers in neuroscience proved reddited true tide powerfully neuroprotective. I could just turn off the podcast right now. Reduces neuroinflammation fueled by angry micro gle micro gleal cells. Micro ga are the immune death dealers in your brain. They're the immune cells that attack everything in your brain except they're attacking you right now. They promote synaptic plasticity, not micro ga reatride, which is the brain's ability to rewire itself and they improve cerebral glucose metabolism. That's how all the triple agonist works. Tapping all three of those receptors changes your brain. Red at true tide is so nuclear, it launches this fullcale attack on systemic insulin resistance and inflammation. Listen, I got to get this out. It douss the fire. is burning down your brain. Think of your brain's bloodb brain barrier as this. It's a border crossing. How fitting. It's a border crossing. Red or true tide comes in, calms the inflammatory riot on the systemic side. So now all the border guards can get back to doing their job instead of being overwhelmed. This isn't slowing cognitive decline. Are you getting that? This is active targeted neuro restoration. It's bringing a dead metabolic landscape back to life. And yet people go, "I would rather take L-dopa, Parkinson's, all the nonsense, whatever else they're giving you." Stop. Look at PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome. It's one of the greatest misnomers in medicine. I fully believe that it's not an ovarian disease. It's a metabolic disorder that uses the ovaries as a boxing ring. 19 endocrine connections established the chain of causation and proved it. It proved about what what I just said it without any shadow of a doubt. Insulin resistance one before anything else. So it's not an ovarian problem. Right out of the gate, you get this right. Insulin resistance is a byproduct of systemic infla inflammation. Huh? Systemic inflammation causes what? Mitochondrial disc like dysfunction. So ATP shortage, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance. You see how this is all coming together. So hyperinsulinemia is the second thing that happens after insulin resistance. Insulin resistance and people think hypo no hyperinsulinemia. Now that this is what happens. It overstimulates the ovaries to produce excess androgens like testosterone which leads to cysts anobulation infertility and the standard of care. I don't know if you guys have paid attention but they give you something called metformin. It's a drug that gently coaxes the liver right a true tide doesn't coax baby it obliterates. So by annihilating the root cause the insulin resistance it removes the signal that's telling the ovaries to malfunction in the first place. The cysts the hair growth the infertility. These are symptoms you guys. That's not the disease. That's the giant flag that they're waving going, "Hey, there's something wrong. Help me." Reddit truth tide extinguishes the metabolic fire that creates the smoke. And yet, people are still treating the symptom, not the cause. I could do this with anything. Cancer, you name it. Look at menopause. This is I'll go deeper into this. This is like a metabolic cliff. Menopause isn't just hot flashes. It is a metabolic cliff dive. The protective effect of estrogen on insulin sensitivity vanishes. The mitochondrial function that estrogen supported goes off that cliff. Red or true tide is the rope that you throw to somebody falling and manage the catastrophic metabolic fallout that's occurring. But to actually win this and I got to go a little deeper in this because it's otherwise I'm going to leave something on the t I'm going to leave money on the table for you guys. You need a partner. You pair red or true tide with MC C 2021. This is a wicked study. Nature communications identified Mont C as a mitochondrial derived peptide that's the master regulator of metabolic homeostasis. Follow me on this. Under stress, especially under stress. Watch. Here's how it works. True tide handles the hormonal signaling crisis. C parachutes in and directly repairs the mitochondrial decay. It's like the double tap. Edrutide is the general directing the war from HQ headquarters. Mot C is the Delta Force, Chuck Norris on the ground fixing the broken power plants. And together they don't just help you survive menopause, they allow you to thrive through it and have your system get back online. There's a whole bunch of things you could do for menopause. This is one of the best ways to handle it. And let me explain. This is how you personally guarantee reddit tites failure. I have to tell you cuz you guys are like, "I'm going to go try this." Hold on. Land the plane. Just sit with me for a bit. It's a masterpiece of biochemical engineering. It's you. The variable isn't the peptide. It's you. The wild card. The reason it fails. Here's your personal road map to wasting every dime you possibly can on Red True Tine. I'll give you all the roadblocks so you can avoid them. Estrogen. Estrogen. Oral estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy, HRT, and birth control pills, by the way, are a metabolic anchor. 2013 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism was very blunt. Oral estrogen induces insulin resistance and promotes a pro-inflammatory state. So you're asking, I said this at the beginning, you're asking reatride to run 100 meter dash while you're chaining a 100 pound weight to its ankle. The pharmacological antagonism is direct and powerful. If you are on oral estrogen and wondering why your results are less than mediocre, the problem isn't the peptide. The problem is all the other prescriptions in your cabinet, you're funding a civil war inside your own body. And red of truth tide, I'm sorry to say, it's on the lousy side of this entire equation. Look at the bro science. Here's another one. This I see this everywhere. You guys in your bro science doses are unreal. The mentality of if taking 2 milligs is good, then four milligs must be better is the kind of profound pharmacological literacy that gets people hurt. Listen to me. It gets people hurt. The side effects aren't bad on Red True Tide. The idiots using them are making the side effects bad. Clinical trials exist to find therapeutic window. Bro science exists because people need to stroke their ego and their shills for people selling this stuff that have no business selling it because they know two things about him. Jack and [ __ ] and Jack left town. The dose range where efficacy is maximized and side effects are minimized. That's the therapeutic window. Just so you need if you need a definition, efficacy is maximized, side effects minimized. That's where you need to live. 2023 Lancet trial showed a very clear plateau. Clear. clear as glass in dose responsive curve. Just so you know what it is. Beyond a certain point, you don't get more weight loss, you get more nausea, more vomiting in this order, by the way. Nausea first, vomiting, higher risk of pancreatitis, diarrhea, cramping. The sweet spot is not determined by some anonymous idiot on Reddit quoting their gym bro. It's determined by a multi-million dollar multi-phase clinical set of trials. Thinking that you know better is the height of arrogance and stupidity. More is not better. More is dangerous. And this goes for everything. You could alcohol and sades. You could pick something. It'll be like this. How about this one? Passivity. I'm giving you all the roadblocks so you have them. And you check the box. And you know what people are going to do is they're going to get really mad and go, "But that's not me, bro. It just doesn't work for me." Wrong. You're just not willing to look at yourself. You're willing, you want to blame the peptide. Unless you bought something with rice powder in it cuz you bought it from some idiot online that has no business selling it. That's why people buy at Elite. We don't test locally with all these manufactured COAs that you guys are getting from local labs that you buy your results from. I go to a lab that actually guarantees the results and if not they buy the whole thing. Nobody wants to write that check just so you know. So they make sure they're honest. Use genoc. This is the ultimate failure passivity. The belief that the injection is the substitute for action. Read a true tide is a powerful catalyst is the word. It's not a substitute. It's not going to build muscle for you. It's like taking testosterone sitting on the couch and eating Doritos all day and going why am I not jacked and why am I still unhealthy? Cuz you're stupid. you expected it to do the work that you're supposed to be doing. It's not going to make you drink water instead of soda. It's not going to force you to sleep eight hours or six hours a night, regular cortisol, get sunlight in your eyes first thing when you wake up. It's not going to do any of that. It's going to optimize your metabolism, but it doesn't replace the fundamentals. The person who combines reduide with resistance training and real food, real nutrition, stress management, great environment makes this a staple part of their life, god-like results. Period. Person who injects, sits on a couch, listens to bro science, is going to achieve mediocre at best. The drug opens a door or the peptide opens a door. Still have to walk through it, man. Listen, here's the uncomfortable truth. Red or truth tide is it's a revelation, man. It's the most potent metabolic tool I think I've ever seen in my life. Triple agonist key that will guaranteed unlock a healthier, more powerful, longer health span, longer lifespan, more vibrant life. Like, it is so effective. I have yet to see something if I had to choose just three. And I know I've made posts on this, but this would probably be in those three. You got to understand though, this key is useless if the lock is corroded by, like I said yesterday, mitochondrial decay and blocked by the debris of corticosteroid use or if you are personally pouring battery acid of a poor diet and stupid decisions and drugs and antagonistic medications into the mechanism every single day and going, "This doesn't work. The peptide sucks. I'm going to go back to semiglutide." You should. Here's your sign. You're still going to do dumb things. It's not the molecule in the vial that you need to worry about. It's the idiot holding the syringe. You need to have the courage to look at your own life and go, "Where am I screwing this up? Where am I dumping sabotage into my own system and expecting it to come out of a vial? It's the discipline to partner the peptide with intelligent action. I'm giving you this so you actually have the answers." Red a true tide doesn't just give you a fighting chance. It gives you the answer. But the fight's still on you. You like it's not magic. It doesn't go, "Hey man, I have a Goliath in front of me. You still have to be David. You need five smooth stones." It doesn't just go, "Let me go get a David for you." You're waiting for some savior. You're the protagonist in your own health story. Red True Tide is just the best supporting actor that you can hire. You have to look at it this way. And if not, I don't know. I don't know how to help you. But it's probably the most effective thing I've ever seen in my life. Anyway, hope you got something out of this. I got to go. Never miss.
