I wasn't going to do this one because this one's personal to me a lot actually. This is all about PTSD. This is a PTSD master class. This is solving PTSD. And really, I don't I got nothing to gain. I got nothing to sell you. I've got nothing for you to buy. If you, like I said, you want to join the black card, you know what? 9997. You wire it to, you know, my executive assistant, Mia, she'll take care of you. You send an email to apply unlockthecard.com and you get to hang with me every Monday at my live Q&A that I do where you can throw every question you've got at me. You get access to the protocol library. You get access to me VIP in the app and it's actually me and I answer all your questions right down to labs or anything else like that you need help with. And I provide real solutions and I solve problems all day. And my turnaround time is 24 hours to 72 hours. It's really fast. People that have been involved with doctors for 10, 15, 20 years and gotten no results have changed their entire life in two days. But I don't care if you buy that or not. I that's not what I'm here for. And it's it should be $25,000. I just You guys need help. And if I hear anybody whining about it going, "It used to be six grand. You know what? Don't join." Then your health isn't really that important and it's going to go up. I just haven't really decided when. I just I really want to help people. And at the same time, I think the problem is a lot of people don't want the help. They want the help. They want a free solution, which they're never going to do anything. They're never going to do anything with. And if you want to buy from my company, Elite Biogenics, then buy from me. Great. It's the It's the same stuff that I give my wife and my children and my mom. And I would say my dad. My dad passed away 14 years ago. That's why I don't say my dad. I want people to be juggernauts with their health. And current medical the current medical model is managed decline. And all the medical doctors coming out of medical school right now, they're just trades people, pharmaceutical reps. And you might get offended if you're an MD or you're a wannabe MD or you're about to become an MD and you're Sally medical doctor. I really don't care. Do better just because you know how to parlay the KB cycle to people and you understand what covealent bonds are or whatever it is you're talking about. Nobody cares. Nobody, to be honest, nobody gives a crap that I understand biochemistry or chemistry or physiology or biology. Nobody cares. They care that I can solve their problem. And when people come to me, CEOs of massive companies, because their personal physician that they spend a million dollars a year on can't solve their problem, and they come to me, and I solve it in a day or two, there's a reason, and it's because I look for their actual problem, the cause. I don't try and paint over it. Hopefully, that something shows up like it just covers it. It's like a gold-plated turd. It's still a turd. I just don't do it. And it's tough love. and I demand high standards and if you don't do things the way I want them done, I'm not going to help you cuz I can't help you if you're not going to listen. But I do this because I genuinely give a crap about mankind and I want to save humanity and that's why I'm here. So PTSD is a big deal to me because I have friends that are going through it and I have friends that have gone through it and there are millions of people out there that feel like there's they get SSRIs and bzzoazipines and antiscychotics thrown at them like those are going to cause anything other than a catastrophe. I'll prove it. I'll prove it. Those things are a waste of time. They don't even they don't even solve the problem. They just cover it up with a thick coat of paint and the person still has to deal with this personal hell. And it's not a psychiatric problem. It's not a psychological problem. This is a biological problem. Like, it's real. PTSD is real. So, here's a PTSD master class designed to solve PTSD for you. If you watch it, I don't need the view time or anything, but if you watch, however long I'm going to be on here, 45 minutes, an hour, 2 hours, however long it takes, whatever. Maybe you should just pay attention and take notes. But if you pay attention to this old doctor here with the Spartan hat and the gritty old beard and the gray in his face and the wrinkles in his eyes, you know what? He's going to give you the answer because I want you to understand what's going on so you can maybe if it's not even you can help other people. But PTSD has a damn solution and it's not what they're currently doing. You guys, what you've been told about PTSD is so incomplete. It's not wrong. It's not because some of it's accurate, but it's incomplete. It's like trying to understand cancer by only looking at a tumor. Then you miss the Warberg effect or I guess the reverse pasture effect, right? There's a million ways you can look at this. for understanding heart disease by only measuring inflammatory markers and that's it. You're missing 90% of the actual story. And here's the thing, once you understand real biology and you have someone like me that just wants to help you, you won't just understand, in this case PTSD differently or whatever it is you're listening to, you'll understand why most medical treatments, when I say most, unless they're saving your life, and even then, who knows what they're pumping you full of anymore. This is why they fail catastrophically. And you'll understand with PTSD why some people recover and others don't because they're treating the wrong thing. And it's not a, like I said, it's PTSD is not a psychiatric problem with biological consequences. It's a biological problem that creates psychiatric symptoms. And the distinction is the entire game. Listen, let me paint a picture at the fundamental cellular level because the brain isn't magic. It's physics and chemistry. you experience some traumatic event. Let's I don't I use this in my Instagram. So, it's easy. It's like you're in a car wreck, right? Car rolls over and hits a tree or something happens. I, God forbid, it's some catastrophic drunk driver, something like that. And within just a fraction of an instant, like lightning flash, it so fast your amydala, that little homage shaped structure in your lyic system, detects this as a threat. It's designed to do this, but it doesn't wait for your conscious mind to process it. It hijacks you. And here's what happens. Your locus corius floods your system with what else? What else do you think? Norepinephrine. This is the brain's panic button. It's just tapping it like it's going out of style. Your pupils dilate. Heart rate spikes. Blood pressure skyrockets. Your digestive system goes completely offline and all your blood gets redirected to your muscles. Fight, flight, freeze. Right? You could say fight, flight, or [ __ ] It depends on whatever you want to say, but it's the three Fs. But here's the problem, and this is crucial. your hippocampus, which is supposed to be contextualizing all of your memories, gives them a time stamp. It gets offline during any kind of extreme hyper trauma. It's like the event recorder at an accident scene just stops working. So, your amydala now encodes this memory with absolutely no context, no temporal markers, no logical narrative, nothing. This creates what neuroscientists like James Pitman, he discovered this in 1989. It's a memory that is completely locked in time. It's not the way it's supposed to be. It's overconolidated. The proteins, the synaptic strength, the dendritic connections, the entire consolidation is abnormally amplified. This is very bad because now you fast forward a month, a week, a year, years later even, and something. You're in a car and it swerves. It jerks to the side of the road. You smell somebody torching off their tires. It's burnt rubber. You're It doesn't matter. Whatever it is, you hear brakes squealing, but your amydala, something that trips that memory. Your amydala doesn't think memory, though. It thinks there's a threat happening right now. And your entire nervous system reactivates as if the accident and whatever it is, whatever trauma is happening right at that specific moment in time. That is not a psychiatric symptom. That's persistent. That's a that's an encoding problem. False present moment reality is what I call it. PTSD is a biological systemic filing problem where your brain loses the ability to distinguish between what happened and what's currently happening and your nervous system gets trapped in this neverending circuit of trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma. And here's where it gets wild. This is where conventional psychiatry completely psychiatrists are idiots. I have no respect for for psychiatrists. If you're a psychiatrist, you are in a pseudo profession. you are in an absolute pseudo profession. Sorry, not sorry. I don't have any respect for you. This is where they completely miss the boat and they treat everything incorrectly. Watch. PTSD and ADHD aren't comorbidities. They're mechanistic consequences of the same underlying damage and they treat them different. Let me explain the biology. This will blow your mind. Your prefrontal cortex, right, the executive function center. is like the CEO of your entire brain runs on dopamine and it needs consistent regulated dopamine signaling to maintain focus, impulse control, working memory. This is your attentional system. Okay. When you experience any kind of severe trauma, several things happen at the same time. So the VTA vententral tegmental area which is your dopamine factory gets completely disregulated. The trauma causes sustained hyperactivation followed by massive depletion. It's like revving an engine until you red lines and the engine just seizes. So, and now the next thing is your h your amydala hyperactivity directly suppresses preffrontal dopamine activity through GABAurgic inhibition. Follow me. Just stay with me. So, the threat detection center is essentially sending out a constant, hey, quiet [ __ ] We're under attack signal to your CEO. Your stress hormone cortisol at chronically elevated levels actually kills kills like not kills metaphorically kills dopamine neurons through oxidative stress and NDMA or NMDA over stimulation. And the result you can't sustain attention. You can't inhibit impulses. You can't even hold a working memory. That is a DHD. But it gets better. At the same time, you have hypervigilance. Your amydala is just constantly firing. Threat detection is on max sensitivity just scanning all the time and you get emotional dysregulations because you have impaired amydala preffrontal coupling problems. Right? So that switch to the other side of this equation. It's the same equation though. So Rachel Yehuda in 2015 used PET imaging to show 50% positron emission, right? Use it to show 50% that's a big number you guys. 50% of PTSD patients exhibited dopamineergic dysfunction identical to ADHD. Why? Because the mechanisms are the same, you guys. The trauma didn't create two separate conditions. It created one biological cascade that expresses as both PTSD symptoms and ADHD symptoms. That's why they're married almost all the time. Oh, this gets even better. But this is here's why I said sometimes people get better, sometimes don't. This is why stimulants sometimes work for trauma survivors and sometimes they completely blow up. If your dopamine depletion is extreme, stimulants just create more dysregulation. But if you're dealing with pure preffrontal suppression, then they can be a little bit of a help. It still doesn't solve the problem that it'll help. The real solution is just restore the damn biology underneath both conditions, not treat them separately, which is what the medical world keeps doing. Listen, how about we just go on a nice little fun tour about what trauma actually does to you, your physical body. It trashes you. Look at the neurological system. So when you're in a chronic threat state, your autonomic nervous system lives in sympathetic high speed, just cranked right to the max. The pedal is floored. Your vagus nerve right here, right? Which is pretty much the longest nerve in your body, by the way, running from your brain to your gut. Loses all of its parasympathetic tone. And normally your vagus nerve is like the brake pedal. It tells your body we're safe. We can relax. You can digest. You can heal. You can do all the calm things. Trauma breaks this brake. So Steven Porges called this the poly vagal theory in 2011. It's honestly it's revolutionary because it's fact. Your veagal tone measured by heart rate variability HRV actually predicts PD PTSD recovery 100%. Low veagal to tone poor outcomes. This is here's the here's what you got to understand. This is measurable physical measurable. Look okay look at brain BDNF brain drive neurotrphic factor which is like I always call it miracle growth for your neurons. drops by 30 to 40% in PTSD uh patients. This means your brain literally loses its ability to heal itself. You're not just damaged. You're locked in a state where damage just keeps accumulating andu accumulating. It's like the brakes that never get repaired and they're squealing and then they're gouging holes in the rotors and now you just can't stop at all because it's just raw metal on raw metal and nothing's ever happening except your car catches on fire. Look at your milein, the insulation that surrounds the axons that allows very fast neural communication. It degrades. Research from NIH 2018 showed that PTSD patients have reduced white matter integrity, particularly in the anterior singulate cortex. And what does that mean? It means that your neural pathways are deteriorating like this. And messages are getting incredibly slow and incredibly filled with static. This, listen, I am going to shatter the conventional model. Listen to me. Most people think PTSD is just being stressed out about a past event. Are you faking kidding me? That is ignorance at its highest capacity. It's dead wrong. Dead wrong. Stress is temporarily elevation, a temporary elevated cortisol and adrenaline. That's it. That's stress. The end. It's not in you. It's not in the environment. It's your perception of physical or psychological threat. The end. That's stress. But your body handles it. Your HPA axis, hypothalamic pituitary, adrenal axis activates and then downregulates. The a PTSD is permanent remodeling of that stress response circuitry. That's not even in the same room. Here's the difference in biology. normal stress, your amygdala goes skyhigh. Hippa, your hippocampus, what did I say it does? Contextualizes the prefrontal cortex says, "Okay, listen. We're good. Nothing's bad's happening. So, you can turn this all off and everything downregulates." In PTSD, your amydala is permanently sensitized. It's not some elevated new baseline that you've got. It's a state of persistent readiness. Vessel Vanderolk 2014 showed that PTSD patients have three, this is such a big number, 300% higher amygdala reactivity to threat stimuli compared to non-PTSD controls. That's not stress sensitivity, you guys. That is a fundamental rewiring of threat detection. Here's the real problem with that, though. Your system doesn't just stay alert. It becomes utterly incapable of the normal stress recovery cycle. Because here's what happens. Normally, acute cortisol elevation triggers this negative feedback. It shuts itself off. This is homeostatic regulation. It's how your body's designed. PTSD, this feedback loop broken. Your pituitary stops responding properly to cortisol signals. Your adrenal glands now show altered dural cortisol patterns. Listen, even this PTSD patients have most of them have completely inverted cortical curves high at night when they're supposed to be low creating this horrible experience. Perpetual wakefulness where you can't get any sleep. This isn't stress. This is an endocrinological pathology and it cascades into everything. It's your autonomic nervous system becomes stuck in this sympathetic overdrive. Your immune system enters this state of chronic activation. Your metabolism shifts. your genes start expressing differently. This is systemic. It's biological. This is far beyond what these psychiatrists keep saying is stress management. We can fix it and we'll just add some drugs to you. That's not going to work. It's not going to work. Let me map out exactly what's happening in your brain. Okay, you the amigdula. Look at the amydala. It's the threat detector. PTSD, your amydala undergoes real structural changes. my 2012 using MRI showed PTSD patients have a 61% smaller amygdala compared to controls smaller. So the point is that you'd think that would be less reactive. No, this is the paradox. The amydala shrinks, but the connectivity intensifies. It's like a small amplifier, excuse me, with a volume. It's like Back to the Future, right? Has a giant speaker just crank to max except it's hyperconnected to your threat processing networks and hypo disconnected from your calming networks. Right? You get this? So, hyper connected to threat processing, hypo disconnected from calming networks. The pathways from your amygdala to your prefrontal cortex, the safety override, for lack of a better explanation, are weak. The pathways from your amygdala to your threat memory storage are reinforced. Like we're talking adamantium, vibranium. So, the wiring that says I'm smaller and more focused on one job, that's what it's saying. This wiring says, "I'm smaller. I'm more laser focused on one job. Detect every single threat at all costs." It's when you have when you're out and you're in the dark and everything sounds, you hear everything. You smell everything. You see everything. That's literally what you're running on. I can't imagine the horrific experience that must be. Like I will speak for myself and I was so full transparency. I didn't want to leave the house after I Yeah, I don't even talk about this. So when after I came out of the hospital and imagine being per permanently suffocating all the time. That's what it felt like for months and months. Like I was always I couldn't breathe. And it's not the I'm gasping for breath. It's that I couldn't take a breath no matter how hard I wanted to. It's like I was trying to fill a beach ball this big. But I only was allowed to use this much of the beach ball just like a golf ball size. And I couldn't. It was terrifying because I always kept thinking I'm going to freaking die. And when I was in the hospital it was catastrophic. I told my wife I wasn't going to make it. And it wasn't some cool story for Instagram. It was that I thought I was It was in the early morning, 2:00 in the morning, 1:32, 22 in the morning, and I sent her a text saying, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not going to I'm not going to be able to spend my life with you anymore. I'm not going to make it." And it was the most horrible thing I've ever had to send my wife in our 21 years of marriage. And my wife, if you don't get it, is my best friend. I adore Brandy with every cell of my being. And I can't stand the thought of spending a day without that woman and letting her down, which is what I felt like. I felt like I broke every promise. And she sends a message back says, "I can't do this life without you. I need you. I love you." And you know the whole story. The whole point is it end up costing me a lung. And it traumatized me. And I was so paranoid for probably a month. I didn't want to leave the house. I didn't want to ever get sick. I got a fever or the sniffles. I'd freak out. I went out to go to Starbucks and I didn't want to get out of the car. It took me probably 15 minutes to get out of the car. And then when I went to the door, I didn't want to touch the door. I started washing my hands all the time. I got real weird. And I didn't want to be around people. Anytime there were people, I would always dodge them out because I was so paranoid that I was going to get sick again. And that's just minor compared to somebody that's been overseas or in Iraq or gone through hell or watched their family get killed in a fire or worse. I couldn't imagine that. So when people insult this, honestly, if you're one of those people that discounts this and discredits PTSD, you go right to hell. Cuz this is a very real biological issue. And for all the psychiatrists dumping medicine on these people thinking it's something beautiful is going to grow, screw you, man. You aren't helping a single person but your own wallet. And you damn well know it. And if you don't, you better learn because it's disgusting what you guys do. So listen, you spend your life in hyper vigilance. I couldn't imagine that. And I'm sorry if anybody's listening to this and how devastating that's got to be, which is why I'm out here. I'll solve it for you. Look at the anterior singulate. Okay? It's like a conflict chaperone. So your anterior singulate cortex, and I know we're getting into some neurology, but this stuff nerds me out and I love it. It's supposed to detect it detect when something doesn't match your expectations. It's kind of like social media right now. It says, "Wait, that that in this case shouldn't be dangerous." In PTSD, this region is suffering from reduced activation. You can't override your fear response with logic. So, the siren goes off and your body reacts before your conscious mind can process that you're safe. Your anterior sign, you know, the singulate isn't doing its job. The prefrontal cortex is, remember what I said? It's like the CEO, right, of your brain. This is the cudigrass because your prefrontal cortex is supposed to inhibit amygdala firing through GABA mediated suppression. But in PTSD, this top down control, which is the way you're designed, right? Above, down, inside, out. This topdown control is completely compromised. So you look at neuroim imaging studies, Rous 199 showed consistently hypom metabolism in Broca's area and the prefrontal regions of PTSD. Remember, so if you understand any neurology is Broca and Wariki's area, it's like motor speech and comprehension all these things. So anyway, the prefrontal regions of PTSD patients, the translation is this before we get into neurology. The language centers that let you talk about your experience go offline. Which is why PTSD patients can't verbally process their trauma. You become brokus aphasia. The neural highways for that area are actually damaged. Right? There's Warick's aphasia and Broca's aphasia. So this is Brocus. You look at the locus cruius which is the panic button. It's a tiny little nucleus about the size of a grain of rice. produces somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of the norepinephrine in your entire freaking brain. Oh, it's your panic button. All right, PTSD. It's on fire. We're talking a massive confflgration. Craig Barage 2008 showed that chronic stress causes permanent changes in the locus firing patterns. And here's the problem. The baseline firing rate increases. So, it's not just pulsing or whatever it's going to do. It's just non-stop so much that the threshold for activation drops. Here's what that means. You need less and less stimulation to trigger a maximum freak out panic. Loud noise, smell, shadow, anything, song, you name it. Your system has been reprogrammed for a hair trigger. You know where that's good? A freaking comic book. That's not good for real life. You want to watch the Avengers, that's fine, but that's not real life. Listen, here's something that's going to blow your mind. By the way, there's more neurons in your gut than in your spinal cord, your entic nervous system. That's why they call it the second brain, right? 500 million neurons. And yet, we treat our gut like like we're alleycats. and indestructible, right? We just stuff all kinds of things into our bark hole and wonder why we feel like crap and we go through anxiety and depression because you're smashing neurons. But I bet nobody's ever told you that. It's producing 90% of your serotonin. It's producing GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine. It's not just digesting your food. This thing is thinking. And some of you guys, it's only thinking about fat stupid [ __ ] In PTSD patients, the system is demolished. Mayor in 2009 showed the brain gut access dysfunction and trauma survivors. Listen to this [ __ ] show. The vagus nerve is hypotonic. It's not sending the calming parasympathetic signal. So your gut never gets the safe to digest signal. Your digestion shuts off. Your stomach acid production tanks. Your intestinal motility becomes erratic at best. And at the same time, your systemic inflammation goes through the roof. I'll get to that in a second. which damages your intestinal epithelium. Your gut barrier becomes permeable which gives you this thing called I've gone over this before leaky gut bacterial LPS lipopolysaccharides cross into your bloodstream and this triggers your immune system which amplifies systemic inflammation which signals your amydala that you're under biological threat which increases sympathetic activation which further damages your gut barrier. It is a vicious cycle. Nobody talks about that though. Here's some SSRI. PTSD patients have dramatically altered microbiome composition, lower counts of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, the anti-inflammatory species. You need proteacteria, full of it. You're loaded with proteacteria, which is the pro-inflammatory species. Why? Because your disregulated immune system is essentially killing the good bacteria and selecting for the inflammatory bacteria. Okay, how about this? Your microbiome. Oh, you're going to love this. produces 90% of your serotonin, but it also produces short- chain fatty acids, butrate, propionate, acetate through fermentation of fiber. These fatty acids are your brain's preferred fuel source, especially prefrontal cortex and your hippocampus. The two regions that are just coincidentally, no such thing by the way, I'm just saying it. Most damaged in PTSD. So, watch. Here's what you've got. You've got a damaged gut barrier, disbiotic microbiome, reduced SCFA, short- chain fatty acid production, reduced serotonin production, impaired energy production for brain regions that regulate fear. The gut isn't a symptom of PTSD. It's a driver of PTSD progression. But how many times have your has your psychiatrist talked to you about your gut? Never. Look at the endocrine system. This is your Let me explain why your hormones have gone tits up in PTSD. The HPA axis, hypothamic, pituitary, adrenal axis. It's your main stress response system. Okay? Hypothalamus release releases CR. Okay, corticotropen releasing hormone which signals your pituitary to release act adrenal corticotropic hormone which signals your adrenals to release cortisol. Remember what I talked about, right? The inverted cortical rhythm. The system is designed for acute threats. Cortisol rises, you fight, flight or freeze. FF threat ends, negative feedback suppresses the cortisol, right? Remember it runs on that negative feedback loop and you recover. In PTSD, this is going a little deeper than what I explained. This feedback loop is gone. It's gone. They show that PTSD patients have paradoxically lower baseline cortisol, but excessive response to stress. It's like your system is in constant red alert. So, the baseline resting state is already suppressed and any new threat causes this catastrophic overreaction. Why? Because your adrenal glands are tired. They're fatigued. They've been running at full throttle like NASCAR right to the pedal, 1200 horsepower, whatever it is. Their altered sensitivity to AC. That's what they show with ACT stimulation. Your pituitary has reduced CR receptor density. Fewer receptors mean worse communication, right? So, it's like you you're missing all the speakers and they're further away. Additionally, this gets even better. This is the stuff that nobody is talking about. Your gluccocorticoid receptors, which are the receptors that cortisol bind to, become hyper sensitive, which means less cortisol causes more effect. Your body is trying to compensate for dysregulation by increasing sensitivity. But this creates massive instability. How about the thyroid? When's the last time somebody talked about that? Your thyroid controls the one main thing that you need. Metabolic rate and also core temperature and energy production and PTSD, thyroid dysfunction is common, but almost never diagnosed. Weird, because anybody that comes to see me with PTSD, that's the first thing I check. Huh. Strange. And my results are better than most people. When I say most, everybody else's. Chronic. Watch. It's not to be arrogant or cocky. It's because I actually know what I'm doing cuz I actually spend time to care. Chronic. It drives me nuts. Chronic stress suppresses the conversion of T4, which is the inactive thyroid hormone, to T3, which the active thyroid hormone through increased reverse T3 production. Okay. Openheimer, yes, same name, different guy 2016 documented this in trauma survivors. The result, hypothyroid symptoms, cold, fatigue, weight gain, brain fog, even with, you ready for this part? Normal TSH levels. Tell me that doesn't scream problem. Look at sex hormone dysregulation. Your sex sex hormones regulate neuroinflammation. Nobody talks about that. Also regulate synaptic density and emotional processing. PTSD. These are beyond disregulated. They're demolished, crushed. Women with PTSD, justino, show altered estrogen signaling and reduced progesterone, which is neuroprotective. That's why we talked about menopause and I said that men with PTSD reduce testosterone, which impairs neurogenesis in Wait, what were the areas? Yeah, one of them was the hippocampus right there. PTSD severely inversely correlates with testosterone levels in male trauma survivors. Look at the thyroid immune interaction. This is where it gets really sinister. Low T3 availability activates your innate immune system. Follow me. This is real simple. So your dysregulated thyroid is actually amplifying your immune dysregulation causing all kinds of problems because this is where the real destruction happens. Your immune system has two modes. I talked about this with my descent master class. TH1 cellular immunity, antiviral, antibacterial, and TH2 humoral immunity, antibbody production. Okay? In PTSD, you get a paradoxical immune shift. Chronically elevated TH2 with insufficient TH1 regulation. Here's what happens. Here's this drives me. It's so brutal because every time somebody comes to me with PTSD and we start going through everything, none of these things have been addressed. They get 15 minutes with their with at the VA. You doctors doing that are embarrassing human beings. Here's what you're doing simultaneously, not the doctors, the immune system. Listen to me. You're producing excessive inflammatory cytoines, IL6, TNF alpha, IL1 beta. You're showing reduced cell mediated immunity and you're developing autoimmune reactivity. Except God in his infinite wisdom didn't design you to attack yourself. The problem is that the system is broken. So here's what happens. It's because your constant sympathetic activation suppresses your veagal aerant signaling. The sensory information that your brain gets from your body eerent aer, right? So your brain doesn't know it's safe. So it keeps your immune system on full attack mode. Your dendritic cells, the immune systems centuries, easy become overly activated and so they present auto antigens. So now your regulatory tea cells, the immune systems peacekeepers become depleted. And the result of this chronic systemic horrible thing, inflammatory response and here's the devastating part of this entire thing. This inflammation crosses the bloodb brain barrier. So now your micro ga, which are your brain's immune cells, become chronically activated. They start releasing pro-inflammatory cytoines inside your brain. Ay in 2018 documented that elevated IL6 and TNF alpha predict predict cognitive decline in trauma survivors. Your immune system is literally setting your brain on fire. The neuroinflammation accelerates neurodeeneration. It impairs BDNF brain derived neurotrophic factor production. It damages your milein the wiring the cover on the wiring and it causes oxidative stress. The free radicals that punch holes in every cell that you've got damaging your neurons from the inside out. Okay, sign me up. And this isn't a real biological problem, all right? It's purely psychological. It's just psychiatric. Listen, here's a terrifying truth about all this. It's the precursor to dementia, PTSD. Watch Yaffy 2018 followed 1300 PTSD diagnosed adults found 50% increased risk of dementia diagnosis over 20 years. Here's why. Look at the neuroinflammation. The chronic neuroinflammation that I just talked about causes the micro ga to overproduce amaloid beta and tile proteins. Yeah, I've talked about this before. These are the hallmark proteins of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's and dementia are basically the same thing. PTSD. I don't care what someone says. You can argue with me all you want. You're still wrong. I'm still right. PTSD patients show elevated cerebral spinal fluid amaloid beta at rates comparable to Alzheimer's patients. Look at hippocample atrophy. Your hippocampus is your memory center. In PTSD, it shrinks 10%. This isn't just memory loss, okay? This isn't just memory loss. This is structural brain loss. And once neurons die, they don't regenerate unless you intervene with BDNF promoting strategies, which I'll get to in a minute. Hold on. I want to drink this Coke or keep going. Look at telomeir shortening. Remember telomeirs right with a pitilon. So your telomeirs are the caps, the aglet on the end of your chromosomes. They shorten with age. In PTSD, this process accelerates dramatically. PTSD patients have telomeirs equivalent to someone 10 to 15 years older than their chronological age. And what that means is that your cells are aging faster. Your DNA is degrading faster. You're literally experiencing accelerated aging. And they've normalized this. Look at the mitochondrial dysfunction. I could do this all freaking day. Your mitochondria are cellular power plants. in PTSD mitochondrial genes show altered expression energy production tanks the particular this actually happens in the most part in your brain's most metabolically active regions prefrontal cortex hippocampus so you have accelerated neuroinflammation hippocample shrinkage accelerated cellular aging and energy depletion the result is cognitive cascade memory problems naming difficulties vis visospatial decline full dementia 100 people 50 will get dementia. This is why untreated PTSD doesn't just ruin your emotional life, it destroys your cognitive future. Please listen to me. Okay, so let me connect all these dots. Three biological failures every time. It's where is my Nobel Prize? Where? Yeah, I damn well want it because I want people to get this everywhere. I want to be in every book. Dr. Trevor Bachmire discovered the three biological failures that are the precursor to every single damn disease on Earth. You know what my wife and I were talking about the other day? I said, "You ever wonder why animals never get sick, but humans always do?" But we're so conditioned and indoctrinated to think that's faking normal. Just ruminate on that a little bit. And don't give me some stupid explanation in the comments. The explanation is very obvious. Yeah, you're not supposed to be sick. Okay? Look at every chronic disease. Cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodeenerative disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disease, liver disease, it doesn't matter. The PTSD shares these three underlying mechanisms. Systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and ATP shortage, which is the mitochondrial dysfunction. PTSD is not an exception to all of this. Watch systemic inflammation in PTSD. I'll show you elevated I already know. IL6, TNF alpha, I1 beta, chronic immune activation, neuroinflammation. This is documented in hundreds of thousands of studies. But here's what most people miss. The inflammatory state isn't just a consequence of PTSD. It's a driver of PTSD progression. It drives the entire freaking disease. Because inflammation begets more inflammation. Your immune activation causes endothelial dysfunction. Your blood vessels leak. More immune cells enter tissues. More inflammatory signals propagate. Your amydala detects the biochemical signals of threat and amplifies your fear response which cranks up your immune system which causes more inflammation. Okay, but it's not important. Look at insulin resistance in PTSD specifically. Okay, equally devastating. A little less obvious. Your chronic sympathetic activation suppresses insulin secretion and increases insulin resistance through a couple of different ways. You need to follow me on this. Just stick with me. Believe me, it's worth it. Elevated catakolamines increase hypatic glucose output while at the same time impairing glucose uptake in all your peripheral tissues. Chronically elevated cortisol causes insulin receptor desensitization. And systemic inflammation, which is the heavy hitter, impairs insulin signaling. All of this stuff is combined. You look at Kaitton in 2010 found that PTSD patients have 150% increase of developing type 2 diabetes. But here's the brain's connection. Your brain is phenomenally sensitive to insulin signaling. Insulin is required for BDNF signaling. Insulin is required for synaptic plasticity. It is the brain specific insulin resistance is in the brain. It specifically impairs memory consolidation and emotional regulation which is causing all these problems which is why PTSD patients show progressive cognitive decline. The brains become insulin [ __ ] They don't hear it anymore. Insulin resistant. Don't get all offended. It's just a word. I'm a product of the 80s. I say gay and [ __ ] all the time. Oh no. If my hurty words bother you, you're not going to like me at all as a doctor. Look at the mitochondria dysfunction issue. This is a problem. Your mitochondria produce a denazine triphosphate, right? ATP. ADP screws on an ATP through oxidative phosphorilation and PTSD. This process is compromised all over the place. Mitochondrial DNA show increased oxidative damage because of free radical production from chronic stress activation which is going on because of everything happening because there's actual physical remodeling of your system. Your mitochondrial membrane potential is destabilized by calcium overload caused by excessive NMDA receptor activation during trauma and subsequent dysregulation. So there's a second problem. Your complex 4 cytochrome C oxidase has reduced expression. So it impairs the ETC, electron transport chain efficiency, which means you're not cranking out ATP the way you're supposed to. Your brain becomes energy starved. You sound familiar? Prefrontal cortex, the most metabolically expensive region of your brain starts failing. Neurons can't maintain membrane potential and your s synapses can't fire. Oh, this makes me crazy. Turk 2013 measured metabolic stress markers in PTSD and found evidence of systemic mitochondrial dysfunction with reduced capacity for ATP production. What that means is he showed that your brain ain't making ATP the way it's supposed to. The neurons PTSD isn't a psychiatric psychological condition that happens to have biological consequences. I am so sick and tired of people saying that PTSD is a bioenergetic crisis. Inflammation plus insulin resistance plus mitochondrial dysfunction manifests as psychiatric symptoms. You ever see somebody with liver failure, they are complete spazzes. It ain't a problem with their psychology. It's the toxins running through their bloodstream. Listen, here's why this is cat like medicine is so catastrophically wrong here. I'll explain the pro the approaches they use and why they're flawed. SSRIs, I've been talking about these selective serotonin reuptic inhibitors. Okay, so the logic is PTSD patients have low serotonin. So we just crank up the serotonin. How does that make any sense? This is neurotransmitter theology and it ignores this one big giant word physiology. Because here's what actually happens. SSRIs work by blocking. They block selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. They block serotonin reuptake. Serotonin accumulates in the syninnapse. But in PTSD brains with altered serotonin receptor expression and impaired neuroplasticity, this doesn't create the desired effect. Just so you know, here's what happens. You get blunted emotional processing. So the SSRI dampens all emotional responses, not just negative ones. You can't selectively choose your emotions like that. Patients become emotionally numb, prevents them from processing trauma whatsoever. They're just suppressing it. Your sexual dysfunction goes through the roof. SSRIs impair erectile function and orgasm 60% of users because serotonin mediated sexual response gets completely disrupted. You're not treating PTSD. You're trading one dysfunction for another one that's going to cause catastrophic problems in a relationship. Emotional blunting long-term chronic SSRI use actually reduces BDNF production. Brain derived neurotrophic factor. The miracle growth for your brain over time. Duman 2004 proved this. Your brain's capacity to heal itself decreases while on SSRIs. And then the massive withdrawal symptom. This is fun. When patients try, and I've seen this, even people coming to me try to discontinue SSRIs, they experience serotonin withdrawal, brain zaps, dizziness, severe anxiety. Isn't this part of the problem? This creates this iatrogenic trauma. Trauma caused by the medicine patients relapse into PTSD because they're being pharmacologically traumatized by their own damn withdrawal. How is this solving the problem? The side effect profile is devastating. weight gain, apathy, anodonia, which is the inability to experience pleasure, worsening suicidality in young people. The efficacy, just so you know, 30% response rate at best. 50% have zero improvement. And for those who do improve, the improvement is minimal, often not functional recovery, just symptom reduction. But you, if you're a psychiatrist, you're going to get in my comments, you're going to argue, and you're saying, "Oh, it works for all my patients cuz you're some magic frigin sigment freud." Got it. Okay. How about the bzzoipines? These are a nightmare, by the way, because if you stop these cold turkey, they will kill you. Just let me hear. Listen to me. I'm not screwing around here. Don't Don't take what I'm saying lightly. Do not, if you're on these, do not stop these cold turkey. Don't. Seizures, all kinds of things happen. You don't do it. So, the logic is here. The anxiety is elevated. Benzoazipines reduce anxiety. So, benzoazipines then subsequently, of course, treat PTSD. Pardon? This is arguably worse than SSR. Here's how benzoazipine works. It enhances GABA signaling. GABA is inhibitory. benzoazipines make your entire nervous system less responsive. Here's the problem with this. Your nervous system needs to be able to differentiate threat from safety. It's how you're wired by God. So, if you chemically suppress all neuronal firing, you're preventing your brain from doing the cognitive work of processing your trauma. How is that going to help you? Never mind the tolerance development. Your brain downregulates GABA receptors in response to chronic benzoazipine use. Look at McJagger. Guy's taking handfuls of these things like Skittles. You need higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect. This is called dependence, not addiction. Physical dependence, not the same. Just so you know, there's a memory impairment component to this. Bendazipines impair explicit memory formation by suppressing hippocample LTP, long-term potentiation. Here's what it does. It prevents trauma processing and learning new safety information, which means your brain isn't building and growing the way it's designed. Your neuroplasticity goes to the dogs. There's paradoxical disinhibition. Okay, so benzoazipines actually increase aggression in some people by 40% with people with PTSD. Impulsive impulsivity, risk-taking. Bust out 2002 show this, prove this. You're supposed to be calming someone and instead they become more volatile and dangerous. Got it? And the withdrawal, I may as well touch on this. Benzoazipene withdrawal is actually it is actually dangerous. You need to listen. Don't screw out of this. Don't listen to what I'm listening to what I'm saying. Please use your ears. Just pay attention. seizures, psychosis. It's among the worst withdrawal symptoms of any psychiatric medication on earth. And here's the cruel part. The guidelines, nice, right? The VA, DoD, they all recommend against benzoazipines for PTSD. They make PTSD worse, but they're still prescribed constantly because they provide short-term symptom relief above all harm. You doctors need to stop [ __ ] that up. Oh, I've been a doctor for a long time. I don't care what you want to insult me with. I see real patients. I've seen over a million patients and I'm still helping people to this day and I will do it until God calls me home because I actually care about the person. Above all, do no harm. Look at the antiscychotics. This is the one that gets me. Use of antiscychotic off label for PTSD. Okay, respperadone is usually the one they use. The logic watch. PTSD involves hyperactivity and threat processing regions. Dopamine antagonism should probably solve all the problems except here's the catastrophic engine behind this thing. You're suppressing dopamine in a brain that's already, are you ready for this? Dopamine deficient. How is that going to work? How does that even make sense? This is why I tell people like more people are driving around cars that know how to change a tire on their own. Damn. You're driving something you don't know how to do anything with. You don't know how to change the oil, do anything like that. You're doing the same thing with your body. You better know your biology. I think that's important because here's what happens with antisycchotics, okay? Metabolic dysfunction. Antiscychotics cause 100% time weight gain, metabolic syndrome, worsening insulin resistance in about half the people that use it. You're treating a condition that involves mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance by causing metabolic dysfunction. That is back assorts. There's movement disorders. Antiscychotics block dopamine in your motor cortex. So extra parameal side effects involuntary writhing movements. 30% of the people that use it, some are permanent. It's called tardive diskynesia. By the way, there's worsening cognitive function. Dopamine antagonism, just so you know, impairs prefrontal cortex function. So now you're treating cognitive decline by suppressing dopamine dependent cognition. Make it make sense. Emotional blunting, similar to SSRIs, right? Even the anidonia. Dopamine is required for motivated behavior and emotional engagement. Block dopamine and you get apathy and anidonia. No thanks. We got enough of that with social media going around just screwing people up psychologically by changing those, giving the dopamine hits all the time like that stupid pigeon pecking away at that food pellet lever. Right? If you know the experiment, antiscychotics add no additional benefit to SSRIs and PTSD. Stein should prove that in 2016. But here's what he also proved. They more than double the side effects. Listen, it's date night tonight, so I want to knock I want to put a bow on this. But you need to understand here's where you need to go with what I'm giving you. The brain is plastic. The most fundamental neuroscience discovery of the past 30 years is that your brain can rewire. Neurons can regenerate. Your neural networks can be completely rebuilt. But this rewiring requires very specific conditions. So I will give you the exact conditions so you can do this. And I normally don't do this here because for some reason when I help somebody right down to the end of the line I get censored. Make it make sense. So condition one you have to meet these conditions without question. Condition one you have to have s sufficient BDNF brain derived neurotrphic factor. BDNF is essentially the hardware upgrade for your brain. It's required for neurogenesis, synaptoenesis, synaptic strengthening. It's required for all of the things that make your brain more robust. The key insight BDNF production, you love, you're going to love this, is actually activity dependent. Your brain produces BDNF in response to certain things. Cardiovascular exercise specifically, actually hip training, cognitive novelty, discovering new things and figuring them out. Get a bunch of puzzles. Really, I'm not kidding. Not puzzles with pieces. Brain benders, things like that. Social connection, which is the opposite of what most people with PTSD do. Sleep, proper nutrition, particularly I'll leave you with there. antioxidants, minerals, and omega-3s. When you restore these conditions, BDNF goes up, your brain's capacity to heal increases. Condition two that must be met, reduced neuroinflammation. This is huge. Your micro ga need to shift from M1, the pro-inflammatory, to M2, the anti-inflammatory tissue repair phenotype. I've talked about this many times. They exist for a reason, but being stuck in M1 is going to cause all the problems. Here's what's required in order to do this. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 to 4,000 milligrams a day. Polyphenols, circumcin, rveratrol, you need to reduce all your systemic inflammatory triggers, which means part of it is stop eating like an [ __ ] Stop drinking, stop doing those kinds of things. Stop going without sleep. Proper veagal tone restoration. That's condition two. Condition three, this is the big one, metabolic restoration. So your and this isn't all in conjunction with my three biological failures by the way. All of this is you have to solve these three otherwise this is not going to work. Your mitochondria need to be restored to full capacity and this requires proper glucose control which means you can't have insulin resistance. You have to have sufficient micron nutrients. So magnesium, zinc, CoQ10, carnitine. You need to have reduced oxidative stress. You need to have proper thyroid function which is what I said the T4T3 issue the TSH normal. Yet there's still all kinds of problems, right? But when these conditions are met, your brain repairs itself. This isn't theory. This is documented neuroscience. Norman Toolage, 2015, hundreds and hundreds of neuroplasticity studies showing that even catastrophically damaged brains can functionally reorganize and recover to 100%. The reason conventional treatments fail is they don't create the conditions required, these ones specifically, to repair. In fact, they often times prevent them. But when you address the underlying biology, you solve systemic inflammation, you solve insulin resistance, you solve the mitochondrial dysfunction, the ATP shortage, you restore BDNF, and you restore mitochondrial function across the board, even in your neurons. Recovery becomes possible. Let me explain this really quick, and then I'm going to go inside for date night with my wife. I want to hang out with her. I'll put the exact protocol from line by line exactly how to do all this. It'll be in a link somewhere under here. It doesn't cost you a damn thing. If you go, "Oh, there's a Google form I have to fill out." Yeah. Name, email, and that you agree. That's it. I'm not going to market to anybody that's downloaded my research knows I don't market the hell out of you, so it doesn't really matter. Anyway, the point is, I'm going to give you this real quick. So, here's the breakdown of what needs to happen outside of what I just said with those three fundamental things you need to solve. CAX, okay, BDNF upregulation, it restores dopamine. BPC57, it's going to restore the gut barrier, the brain barrier. It's going to have dopamine effects. TB500, it's going to provide axonal regeneration. It's going to modulate your immune system. Cerebroly, gold, neurogenesis, neurop protection. DIP, it's going to help with your sleep restoration and your stress reduction. GHKCU, copper, gene expression on the right side, wound healing. Thyosin alpha 1, it's going to solve the immune problem that's going on that you don't even think you have. Alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism in the form of a patch modifies micro ga. Shuts down neuroinflammation. But you guys, there you go. That's it. You're welcome. The rest of it is going to be in some because I'm going to be on here for three more hours if I do this, but this is peer-reviewed research from legitimate institutions that talk about all this stuff. I could do this all day. You need here's what you need to understand. For decades, we have treated PTSD as if it's this broken brain that needs chemical compensation. So, we give SSRIs, benzoazipines, antisycchotics. We suppress symptoms while the underlying biology continues to crumble. Patients don't recover. They just become medicated versions of traumatized people. But what if I told you that the brain doesn't need compensation. It needs restoration. Like I said, your brain is plastic. It can regenerate and heal and rebuild itself. It's designed this way. You understand this, right? Your biology is you have been conditioned to think by modern medicine that your body is suffering because it's lacking something. You were built to need nothing. I'm not saying you don't need it to solve a problem, but I'm saying once the problem solved, you don't need it anymore. You need the right biological conditions, sufficient growth factors, BDNF and GNF, reduced inflammation, the micro gal regulation you need to restore the energy production. So the mitochondrial function I'm giving you the answer, proper sleep, it enhances the lymphatic function. So it works the pressure washer for your brain. Proper barriers, gut, blood, brain, cellular, restored stress resilience. So the HPA axis, proper immune function, the TH1, TH2 ratio, the balance needs to be there. When you provide these conditions, you know what happens? Something remarkable. Your brain just go ahead. It fixes itself. Doesn't suppress, doesn't medicate, fixes. Traumatic memory integrates. The hypervigilance resolves and the emotional dysregulation normalizes and the cognitive decline goes the other direction. It reverses this. This is pure biology and physiology. None of this stuff is magic. This is what happens when you stop treating the problem and you start treating the system. And the beautiful part about all of this is this is reversible. PTSD is not a life sentence. It is a solvable biological problem with a very well understood mechanism and very validated solutions. Trauma treatment isn't more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It's biological restoration. To be honest, it's peptide mediated neuro neuro regeneration, systemic healing. Like I I don't know what you expect with PTSD, but anything that they've told you, you should ignore. But you need to understand. You're listening to this podcast thinking you're going to hear about PTSD, but I want you to leave with an understanding of how to actually fix human neurobiology. It's the difference between medicine and science because they try and marry them together, but they're not. It's drug pushers and modern cartel and science. It's the difference between treatment and healing. So, I think honestly I could I probably lay out the entire protocol in here. It's just I'll be on here for so long. Read what I put under here on the link and solve your life or someone's life, man. I'm not here to sell you a damn thing. I'm giving you the answer. So, just go freaking do something about it. Anyway, I got to go. Hope you got something out of this.
