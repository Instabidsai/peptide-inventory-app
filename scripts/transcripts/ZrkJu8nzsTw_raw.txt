Man, I'll tell you this. I'm going to have to get this one done in about 22 minutes because I have my webinar every Sunday at 4:00. I do a free webinar. I help you guys. I give you guys advice. I teach you things that I've learned, I've done, accomplished in decades of being a doctor. And I give it all to you. And then, yep, there's people go. Is there a pitch? Yeah, it's about 90 seconds. It's for my black card, but you get a deal when you come to my webinar. Anyway, listen. The whole point is this, and I'll be real quick with this one, cuz I want you guys to get this information. And my wife and I were talking about this, and one of my really good friends actually asked me something. He was talking about longevity, and I thought, you know what? What are my personal favorite longevity peptides? And you guys have asked me that a lot. And on a quick tangent, thank you for all the questions you guys keep sending me. I'll keep answering them as much as I can. But he I need you guys to understand something. You're all going to die. And it might sound really harsh. It might sound really abrupt. It's just a fact. And some of you guys are going to die slowly and painfully and very expensively. And you'll thank the people profiting from it. And others, you're going to listen to me. Understand, we're in the golden age of stupidity. We have more information, more technology, and more supposed expertise than any other time and point in human history. And we're collectively dumber about our own health than a caveman trying to avoid a friaking saber-tooth tiger. The caveman had better instincts. Really think about that. Everyone that's listening to this right now is chasing longevity. Whether you think so or not, whether you agree or not, you are. And 99% of the people listening to this are doing it wrong. And that's not meant to be insulting. It's meant to wake you up. You're treating symptoms. Listen, you guys are treating symptoms. You're playing a game of medical, what I call all the time, whack-a-ole, with a system designed to keep the moles coming all the time. You're not extending your life. You're extending your subscription to a for-profit decline model. Being connected to machines are anchored to 12 prescriptions isn't a lifespan, you guys. It's a revenue stream and you're the product. It's that has nothing to do with longevity. It's a profit. It's a profit system. Real longevity isn't about adding years to your damn life. It's about the same. It's cliche. It's about adding life to your years. Health span. Health span. The period where you are vital and functional and free and operational and you move at capacity and everything is done deliberately and intently because you can. And from a purely biological standpoint, forget the wellness blogs and all the supplement shills and all the people trying to. I'm not trying to sell you anything. Buy the black card.

And you can buy from Elite Biogenics or not. That's entirely up to you. I'm here to give you information. So, this is all about my it's about all the diseases in North America and the world and my personal longevity peptides to mitigate the problem. But health span matters, right? And it comes down to the same thing. The three fundamental catastrophic biological failures I talk about all the time. Three systems that break down and cause every single major disease that kills you. You master these and you make pathology completely obsolete. So, I'm going to go over these again and again because I'm right. Systemic inflammation, right? It's not a swollen wrist or tendonitis in your elbow. This is a low-grade silent systemic war inside your own body. It's a civil war because it's against yourself. Your immune system designed for very short-term threats gets tricked into this state of perpetual alert that it doesn't turn off. The main culprits, by the way, are the same ones I talk about. TNF alpha, IL6, the cytoines that cause the storm in your system. They're signaling molecules that when they are chronically elevated tell your body to attack itself. They damage the endothelial lining of your own blood vessels. Your own system is being ripped apart. They confuse your immune cells and then they create this environment where chaos just happens to be the norm for the entire system. It's like having this fire alarm going off 24/7 in your house. Eventually, you just stop paying attention and the fire burns the entire place down. Does that make sense? And that's only the first one. The second one is insulin resistance. And people have poo pooed this and gone metformin and humalogue pumps and all the stuff we do. None of that. you bourberine. Come on, man. This is the great crippler of your metabolism. Your pancreas produces insulin, which is a hormone that is essentially a key. It's supposed to unlock your cells to let glucose in for energy. But through this diet of sugar and processed carbs and the crap diet bombardment that we all have, you change the locks. Now, your cells go deaf. They stop responding. The insulin key doesn't work anymore. It's just a dead door. So your pancreas in this frantic act like a nightmare landlord starts pumping out all the keys it can trying to get in the door. It's called hyperinsulinemia. That excess insulin isn't just useless. It's incredibly destructive. It tells your body to store fat. It damages your kidneys. It hardens your arteries. It accelerates aging. It is medical metabolic incompetence at a cellular level because they're not treating it. They're making the sound louder thinking that's going to make the deaf person hear. And the third one is the Yes, you can tell it bothers me because it really does. I want you guys to be healthy and I'm giving you the answers for free and there's people out there charging hundreds of thousands of dollars for this stuff and they're they don't even know what they're talking about cuz they're not giving you the right answer. The ATP shortage is the third one. I have 15 minutes so I'm going to haul ass. Adenazine triphosphate which is the currency of life. Every single cellular process in your body is paid for with one currency ATP. It's produced in the mitochondria which are those little power plants in your nuclear reactors in your cells. And when they fail, you go energy bankrupt. The reasons are a myriad. Mitochondrial DNA damage from oxidative stress, inefficient ETC, poor nutrient substrate. There's so many reasons for this, but the result is simple. Your cells can't do their job. They can't repair DNA. Can't clear out all the waste. They can't communicate. They become sluggish and dysfunctional and eventually cancerous or necrotic. You are, you want the rule? I'll make it easy. You are only as young as your mitochondrial function. These three failures aren't isolated. They are a vicious self-reinforcing triad of death. Inflammation be watch inflammation begets insulin resistance. Insulin resistance worsens mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction creates more inflammatory free radicals. It's this perfect suicidal feedback loop and it manifests as every single one of the top five killers in North America. I'll even break down the hit list for you. How about that? Heart disease. You think heart disease is about cholesterol? That's what they've sold you on. That is a marketing campaign, a brilliant multi-billion dollar one. The real story is biology. I'll go through all three biological failures in every disease. How about that? I'll make it even easier. Look at inflammation. Cytoines damage the endothelium, which is the delicate lining of the arteries, right? This creates micro tears. Your body, in this misguided attempt to repair them, slaps a band-aid made of cholesterol and calcium onto it. That's plaque. It's no inflammation, no micro tears, no plaque. Full stop. Look at insulin resistance in this part. Hyperinsulinemia causes your kidneys to retain sodium. This increases your blood pressure. This is a big problem because hypertension isn't an issue if it's transient, but this becomes chronic. So, not just that, it promotes the growth of smooth muscle cells around the damn arteries, making them stiffer, more narrow. So, high insulin tells your liver, it gets even worse. High insulin tells your liver to produce more small dense to produce small dense LDL particles or the kind that caused the plaque. Not the fluffy benign kind, the crappy kind. And now look at the ATP shortage. And this is just one of the killers in North America. The heart muscle is the most mitochondrial dense tissue in your body. It runs on ATP like everything else. But without it, you die. So when mitochondrial efficiency drops, the heart muscle weakens. can't contra can't contract with force, you get heart failure. Simple. Heart disease is not a disease of cholesterol. It's a disease of inflammation. It's a disease of metabolic dysfunction. It's a disease of energy bankruptcy. And that's just one of the five. Look at cancer. A cancer is not bad luck. It's a failure of surveillance and energy. I went over this the other day with SS31. Look at the inflammation portion of it. A pro-inflammatory environment is pro-cancerous. Period. Full stop. Those same cytoines, NFCappa B signaling pathways, they actually promote cell prolifer proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, which is the programmed cell death. They're sending the signal, grow, don't die. They also create free radicals that directly damage your DNA, creating the mutations that lead to cancer. I don't know how you guys can't see this and the medical world is just pulling the wool over your eyes and firing chemicals at you, burning you, slicing you, poisoning you, and saying it's going to work. And they've done it for 80 years. The dumbest mechanics in the world. Insulin resistance. Insulin is a growth hormone. Cancer cells covered in insulin receptors soak it all up. IGF-1, its cousin, is like rocket fuel for tumor growth. So high insulin levels literally feed cancer. The Warberg, the Warberg effect, where 1931 Otto Warberg, what did I say? He opened the hood and explained it all. This is where cancer cells ferment glucose even in the presence of all the oxygen they need. it. It's a direct result of mitochondrial dysfunction and a treatment to cancers and a testament to a cancer cell's ability to thrive in a sugar-rich insulinheavy environment. They're not treating that at all, are they? Look at the ATP shortage. Healthy mitochondria are the guardians of the genome without question. They regulate apoptosis. Listen, if a cell's DNA is damaged beyond repair, the mitochondria trigger suicide. When mitochondria are dysfunctional, this entire failsafe mechanism fails. Damaged cells don't die, they replicate. That's cancer. Cancer is again a consequence of environment that encourages growth, discourages death. Our three failures create that exact environment. How about chronic lower respiratory disease? Things like COPD, emphyma, chronic bronchitis. And it's not just about smoking, you guys. It's about the body's inability to manage the freaking aftermath. The lungs are chronically inflamed. Neutrfils macroofagages release proteolytic enzymes like elastes that break down the architecture of your lungs. The alvoli that little bags that open and close and let you do gas exchange because of the surfactant. This is emphyma. Inflammation causes excessive mucus production and airway constriction. Chronic chronic bronchitis. Insulin resistance correlates strongly with insulin resistance is married to muscle wasting including the respiratory muscles. So the diaphragm weakens, you can't breathe effectively. What do you think this does? Accelerates the decline. It's a rhetorical question. And the repair of lung tissue is insanely energyintensive. So with limited ATP, the body can't heal with any efficacy any of the damage caused by inflammation. So it leads to progressive irreversible destruction of your lung tissue. The disease progresses because the body lacks the resources to stop the inflammatory fire and rebuild what's been torched. cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, stroke. A stroke in the easiest definition is a brain attack. It's like a heart attack for your brain. Systemic inflammation makes your blood sticky. It promotes platelet. It promotes platelet aggregation and the formation of clots. Huh, there's your problem. It also weakens the bloodb brain barrier. So, an inflammatory clot is what shoots up into your brain and causes an eskeemic stroke and you die. Again, high insulin means high blood pressure. Hypertension is the single greatest risk factor for a hemorrhagic stroke. Weakened blood vessel bursting in your brain. I'm not talking about you guys walking around with like an aneurysm like a berry aneurysm or anything. It's a plumbing system that's under constant excessive pressure. Your brain cells, by the way, what did I say? 20% of your basil metabolic rate is attributed to your brain except it's 3% of your body weight. 2% if you really want to get fancy. Brain cells are hogs. They consume a disproportionate amount of ATP. So when blood flow is cut off let's say during a stroke TP supply dam it vanishes instantly neurons die within minutes their mitochondria freaking helpless a stroke is a catastrophic failure of vascular integrity in fact it's a catastrophic failure of energy delivery too because they die look at Alzheimer's disease and all the dementias type three diabetes for a reason by the way it's a metabolic disorder for the brain micro ga which are the brain's immune cells become chronically activated by systemic inflammation. They get pissed off. It's like kicking a hornets's nest. And instead of protecting the neurons, they turn around and start peppering them with bullets, releasing their own inflammatory cytoines right in the heart of the brain becomes resistant to insulin. Insulin in the brain, by the way, is not for sugar uptake. It is a critical signaling molecule for memory formation and neuronal survival. So when this signaling tanks, neurons starve and die. the amaloid beta plaques, tow tangles, all the all of that stuff, all the research shows that they're a response to, not a cause of the problem. They're treating the symptoms. I said this the other day, and I'm right. I'm 100% right about this. Any doctor, I'll go toe-to-toe with you. I'm right. I'm right. This doctor's right. It's a poorly formed scab over a metabolically wounded brain, and they're treating the scab. Listen, the brain's mitochondria become inefficient. They produce less ATP and more oxidative stress. So, without energy, neurons can't maintain their synapses. They can't clear waste products like tow tangles or amalloid beta proteins or communicate. The lights dim and it's not a brown out eventually they go off. Alzheimer's is not some mystery. It's the brain that's drowning in this soup of inflammation, this insulin resistance and this energy deprivation. That is a cause that is problem. The problem was never the disease. The problem is the model. The modern medical system is not designed to address these three root causes because it doesn't make them money. It's designed to manage the end points. High blood pressure. Here's a pill to force your kidneys to work harder. High blood sugar. Here's a drug to piss all that sugar out, starving your cells of all the energy that they need. How does that make sense? Pain? Here's an anti-inflammatory that destroys your gut lining. Taxes and it eradicates your glutathione in your liver and worsens the metabolic health long term. It's whack-a-ole because the moles are recurring revenue. Curing a patient is a one-time event. Managing chronic disease is an annuity. You look at this as a business and you can't unsee it. Which brings me to all the tools that they don't want you to know about. the tools that actually target the root damn cause. Peptides are these short chains of amino acids. They're signaling molecules. It's the body's native instruction set. They all speak Latin and your body speaks Latin. Look at it that way. Unlike the broadspectctrum useless pharmaceuticals that bludgeon the single pathway to death, peptides are these master keys that can and do restore the body's own communication and tell it to heal, regulate, optimize, function, secrete, excrete, destroy, create all the stuff they do. So watch here. You want to make diabet. You want to make disease obsolete. Watch this. These are my favorite ones to do this. Redatride. This isn't just a weight loss peptide. It's that's like a side effect. Redatride triple agonist. GLP1, GIP, glucagon. This is the beautiful symphony. It's the concert. It's the concert of metabolic repair for insulin resistance. It's hands down the most potent agent ever created for reversing insulin resistance. Hands down. Hands down. Type two diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type three diabetes. It sensitizes your cells to insulin, changing the locks back. It normalizes blood sugar, not by forcing it out, but by allowing your damn cells to use it for energy, the way they're designed. The weight loss occurs because your body finally has access to its own stored energy, the fat, instead of being locked out. For inflammation, look at the GLP-1 receptors. They're on immune cells. Redatride modulates the immune response, reducing those destructive cytoines, TNA, IL6. It calms the damn civil war. and the ATP. By returning your body to the metabolic flexibility it's designed to have, you're allowing your body to seamlessly switch between burning glucose and fat. It reduces the metabolic stress on all your mitochondria. Improves mitochondrial biogenesis through improved cellular signaling. It does all the things required to live. Redatai doesn't treat obesity. It treats the metabolic dysfunction that causes obesity. And by doing that, it directly attacks the root of heart disease, cancer, neurodeeneration. Just warming up. BPC157. Oh, I told you I'm going to haul ass, baby. This is a sequence of proteins derived from stomach acid. No, you can't take it orally. Its job is healing. It systemically suppresses NFCAPPA B inflammatory pathway. It increases the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytoines. It doesn't just block the inflammation. It actively promotes the resolution of the inflammation. It doesn't just shut it off and hide it, sweep it under the carpet. So, it just burns through the carpet. for insulin. It reduces or it improves glucose tolerance and increases the this is the best increases the number of insulin receptors on cells. You know what that does? It makes your cells much more insulin sensitive to the insulin that you already have in your damn system. It upregulates VEGF which is vascular endothelial growth factor. It improves blood flow and subsequently nutrient and oxygen delivery, waste disposal which are the fundamental ingredients for ATP production and maintenance. It protects and heals the endothelial lining of all your vascule, which is the very system destroyed by our first failure. It's like sending in the special forces repair team, to every single cell in your body. Look at M C. Yeah, this one's a beauty, man. This is a game changer. This peptide is encoded within the mitochondrial genome itself. It's a messenger from the power plant to the rest of just the cell. So for ATP shortage, its primary domain where it just this thing hauls there. Matsi enters the nucleus, reprograms gene expression to enhance metabolic homeostasis. It essentially mimics the effects of exercise and caloric restriction, the two most powerful known interventions for mitochondrial biogenesis, by the way. It forces the creation of new efficient mitochondria. So the nuclear reactors make more power. Improves insulin sensitivity violently almost by facilitating the glucose uptake into the muscles. Bypasses the broken signaling pathway. And it improves metabolic function by reducing oxidative stress from that ragged trashed out mitochondria that you got supporting that you got sporting around in your system. It indirectly but incredibly powerfully reduces the drivers of chronic inflammation because it solves the problem that's causing the inflammation. It's a software update for your cellular energy production. Look at SS31. I talked about this with cancer for 3 minutes. This thing's awesome. SS-31. This targets the mitochondria with stunning laser precision. It's a deoized lipohilic cat ion which means it has this positive charge that drives it directly to what the negatively charged mitochondrial membrane. I talked about this before the engine of the power plant the etc. Its core function stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, prevents the leak of electrons that create this destructive force, this reactive oxygen species, the free radicals. This improves the efficiency of the ETC, electron transport chain, which means 30 to 40% more ATP produced from the same amount of fuel with less waste, the oxidative stress. It reduces the mitochondrial free radical leak, which means it's reducing inflammation, right? Because that's the key driver of the NLRP3 inflammosome. It turns off the source of the inflammatory signaling. It improves mitochondrial function in muscles and the liver. Directly enhances insulin sensitivity. Listen, a cell with abundant energy is a cell that doesn't need to resist insulin because it functions right. It's like putting in a high performance, cleaner burning fuel additive into every single one of your metabolic cellular engines. Listen, I was going to talk about epitoolon. I'm going to keep going. This is the famous Listen, epitoolon lengthens telomeres. Telomeirs are the productive little end caps on our chromosomes that shorten with age and stress. So it normalizes circadian rhythm. It boosts the antioxidant systems like superoxide dismutase. Makes a very powerful supporting anchor in this entire protocol. It's not one of it's not my top four. It's in my top five. But it creates a cellular environment resistant to DNA damage. This isn't a cocktail. This isn't just throw them together. It's a strategy with overwhelming biological competence. By the way, watch. Retatrutide fixes the systemic metabolic dysregulation. It demolishes the inflammation. BPC57 repairs the tissue damage that the dysregulation caused in the first place. MS and SS31 work together. MCI builds new efficient power plants. Mitochondrial biogenesis and SS31 supercharges and protects all the existing power plants from any further damage. So together they don't just mitigate the three failures, they reverse them. They create this internal ecosystem where pathology isn't just managed. It's pretty much rendered obsolete. The body is returned to where it's designed to be, where you're supposed to be in a state of coherence, where it's innate intelligence, all the things that are operating right now that you're not thinking of. They can operate without the constant noise of inflammation, energy crisis, and metabolic confusion. Anyway, I got to go. Hope you got something out of that. I love you guys. Never miss. I just had my Sunday webinar. I told you I had to get off on my podcast earlier. I came back to finish this up because I figured there's some stuff I was missing because I was thinking as I was giving this webinar like see my watch right it's 20 after a five and the problem here's why you haven't heard of any of the stuff I was talking about right you haven't heard of how MSI or reat tide or SS31 or all these things how they solve these problems how BPC1 and everybody heard of BPC157 how many times have you had your doctor recommend it how many times have you had surgeons tell you BPC TB GHKCU PEG MGF how many have you heard actually go this is what you need to You don't cuz it doesn't it gets you better too quickly. This is why you haven't heard of this. It's why your doctor, which is a good person for the most part, I think. And you know what? I don't know about that. Maybe I need to retract that. Maybe 20% are good and the 80% aren't. But the 20% that are good are trapped in a bad system. They're going to look at you like you've got three heads. If you mention anything other than what they're telling you, the narcotic chemotherapeutic methate disaster predinazone nightmare cocktail that they have you on for just about everything. Listen, the FDA is not a safety organization. It is a regulatory gatekeeper. Its primary function is to approve, listen, it's to approve molecules that are patentable, most of which generate huge amounts of money and zero efficacy for your health. Just so you know, like peptides, most of those that are most of them are native to the human body, by the way, are notoriously difficult to patent. They go through so many hoops trying to do it, and when they do, they add all kinds of filler and garbage in them to make them toxic to you anyway and not do the job they're intended to do. So why in the hell are you taking them when they're made by a pharmaceutical company? If you think Eli Lily is going to make Reddit true that actually works and does what it says it's going to do, [ __ ] They're not going to do it. They're not going to do it because it's going to put them out of business if it does or they're going to charge such an exorbitant amount of money that you won't be able to afford it. Listen, I have no problem saying, "Hey, listen. There's red tide. It's going to cost a thousand bucks if it's real and it's going to save somebody's life and mitigate insulin resistance, systemic inflammatory problems, and solve the ATP issue, solve dementia, Parkinson's, MS, Alzheimer's. If it's going to do all that stuff, if it's going to add longevity, absolutely. I'll pay a,000 bucks a week for that. I'll pay $1,000 a day." But they're not going to give you that because then that takes away the customer from their managed decline model where they want you in all the time because it generates trillions 3.7 trillion dollars last year. No patent, no billion dollar exclusivity window. No exclusivity, no financial incentive for a pharmaceutical company to spend hundreds of millions of dollars running them through the FDA's gauntlet that you can buy your way through anyway for $10 million. You can put it on a shelf. Didn't know that, did you? It's the research is everywhere. So if you deny it, you can get in my comments and start chirping away. I don't know what to tell you. The system is not built for cures. It's built for chronic management. It is a sick care system, not a health care system. It profits from you guys. It profits from your ignorance, your lack of knowledge of human biology, physiology, endocrinology, and your compliance with your own managed decline. It's counting on. That's all it's doing. You've been taught to be very passive and timid and trust the people in the white coats with the god complex who demand that you do what they do, who will call you. Listen, I have been at home where my wife, me have gotten phone calls from doctors saying, "You have to come in. You have to do this. You have to take that. You should be I have clients and patients who've had doctors call them and scold them, berate them, and try and guilt them into doing chemotherapy. Are you out of your mind? Giving somebody methate for systemic lupus arithmettosis when it was rosacea and they could have solved the problem right out of the gate. giving somebody rheumatoid arthritis or giving somebody methtresate for rheumatoid arthritis because it's an off label drug that they can use for a flare up. How does that make even sense? Chemotherrapeutic drugs are 100% poison. They do not solve any cancer problems whatsoever. None. I will take that to my grave. They burn you. They slice you. They poison you. I went through cancer already. I don't need to do it again and tell you all about it. I did it. I've been through it physically. My wife has watched me, resuscitated me. They've taken parts out of me because of it. Not a chance. The medical system is broken, corrupt, and designed to make you worse. You are taught to be this timid little, quiet, passive, compliant customer and outsource your health to a third party that has a direct financial incentive for you to remain sick. Yes, it bugs me. You have all this information. You have all of it. Listen, the science is here. You have all this stuff. You have it. The tools are here. The science is here. The researcher is here. The data is here. The access is here. You have all the stuff. The longevity your life is not your doctor's responsibility. They have been indoctrinating you and treated you and trained you to believe in this dogma that it is their responsibility to keep you healthy and fit and alive. It is not. It is their job to take care of you in an emergency situation. Your medical where the medical system shines for the most part is in emergency care. Anything outside of that, it sucks balls. It's garbage. It doesn't work. If you go to Why is it that you can go to any other country and they have gotten you so conditioned to think if you go to other countries you don't know what they're shooting into you and what they're doing and it's not FDA cleared and it's not it's not in sanitary places. Are you out of your mind? Not a chance. What kind of scary garbage boogeyman are they telling you about right now? It's like saying there's some travel advisories. You better not going go. And then I look at everybody in Cabo right now going it's fine right here. We're fine. I don't know what you're talking about. They want you here. They want you broke. They want you compliant. If you don't think you're living in 1984, you're nuts. Longevity is not your doctor's responsibility. It sure as hell isn't big pharma's responsibility. The choice is incredibly simple, just so you know. You can die on their terms, which is slowly, profitably for them, or you can live on your own terms. You can actually go, "This is longevity. This is my life. I can control the things I'm doing. I can solve systemic inflammation. I can solve insulin resistance. I can solve the ATP shortage and prevent the top five problems from killing me." Three failures, five diseases, four simple peptides. This isn't some podcast little foofoo motivational talk. This is like a wakeup call for you guys. I don't know how else to say it. Lifespan, health span, all waiting. It's your job to go take it. I don't know. I just I had to get this out at the end. Hope you got something out of this. I got to go. Never miss.
