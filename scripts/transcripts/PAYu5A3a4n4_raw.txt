52 years old. And the sensitivity meter of most people nowadays when they hear the truth delivered in a very blunt and direct version of the truth, the sensitivity goes off the charts. Some of you guys are losing your mind because of my delivery. Don't listen. I'm here to help you. That's it. You know, somebody asked me, they're like, "Well, not not all of us have a bunch of money to spend on peptides." Part of me struggles with that because your cell phone bill is 300 bucks and you have the latest iPhone and you're paying a lease on a car that you probably don't need and you have ESPN for, I don't know, 180 bucks. I'm making these numbers up. I have no idea how much it is cuz I don't really watch TV. But the point is is that you have a lot of accessories in your life that are billing you 10 bucks here, 50 bucks there, 30 bucks there, and you are a life of subscriptions, but so is your health. A lot of you guys are taking medication. Like, what if what if you didn't have to? What if you really didn't have to? Listen, just listen to me for a second. I'm going to give you the three biggest peptide bang for your buck peptides. Let me let me rephrase that. the three biggest ones that will have the most profound effect on your health and longevity that don't cost you a small fortune to take and will they'll extend your life. The research is there. They'll extend your life and your health span so you can actually do the things you like to do without being in pain and on a bunch of drugs. And it's like I I want you to be able to fire your damn doctor for lying to you all the time. Like you guys are do understand you're being lied to and you're paying for the privilege. But what if you could reverse diabetes or Crohn's or hypertension, which I struggle with cuz it's not real, you know? Or you you weren't lied to about cholesterol or you got rid of kidney problems or cardiovascular problems, excuse me. Or you could lose the weight, you can get fit, you have more energy, you're not sore all the time, your joints actually work, your arthritis starts regenerating the joint, the cartilage, and they'll tell you all of these things that just aren't possible. Why? If I had a business model and it was built on nothing but pain and suffering and I was the solution to the pain and suffering, but it was a long-term subscription-based healthcare model, of course, I would tell you it can't be fixed. I have nothing to gain if by telling you it can all be resolved. It can all be reversed. I have nothing to gain. I don't own a pharmaceutical company. Yeah, I I'm a CEO of a peptide company, but so what? Don't buy from me then. I It doesn't matter. I'm still giving you the information. I still show up here every day. And maybe some of you guys just can't process that. I actually give a damn. I actually come out here and go, I want you to be healthy. I want you to have like this is the only doctor out here that actually cares. And I'm as genuine as it gets. Put me on stage against anybody. Anybody. Put me live against any single human being. And if you go, that's really arrogant. I have every right to say it because I have a stack of receipts miles high behind me of people I've helped and things I've done because I give a [ __ ] about people. And you're like, "Oh my god, but you cuss." I'm a human being. I'm going to be me. I'm not changing. You guys are so indoctrinated to think that people have to change to make you feel comfortable. Don't show up here because I'm not going to change who I am and what I do in order to appease you. And that's the world we live in. I demand you lower yourself and lower your standards and become somebody different so I feel better about myself. Like fun. I'm going to do that. But imagine if you could fire your doctor. You know, a doctor is there for when things go wrong. You guys have been told that you have to go every 3 months for a booster and every 6 months for a checkup. What are you looking for? I grew up when you went to the doctor, you went to the doctor when things are wrong. Because that's what the doctor's job was, not to hunt down things that are wrong that don't exist and then label them and go, "Well, this is probably this bump. I know it's a mosquito bite, but it might be malaria." I don't know what to do with the world at this point because the world is so hellbent on going, "No, you're wrong. I need to take all these drugs. I need fancy explanations, but none of those are accurate. You want to get fit, lift heavy things, and stop eating like a jerk. You want to have a great marriage, give your spouse all the tools to absolutely demolish you, knowing that he or she is not going to do it. You want to make a lot of money. You ready? Here, I'll tell you the secret. It's made me tens of millions of dollars. It's a C word. care. That's all you have to do. And you know what puts that on display? What you do when things are difficult. Maybe ruminate on that a little bit. So, I'll give you the ultimate biggest bang for your buck. And this isn't for you to get in the comments and contest what I'm saying. This is because this is going to solve the three critical problems that cause every disease that man has ever known. Listen, the entire medical industrial complex is built on an single profitable premise. And it's what I always talk about, manage decline. It's a subscription model for sickness. That's why I said you guys have all these subscriptions. I've done it. That's the, you know, that anytime I come out here, it's you're inside my brain. This is what it's like living inside my head. And if you go, "Oh, I hate that." Well, welcome to my world. It's like hurting cats 24/7, 365. My brain never turns off. My brain is always looking to solve problems for everybody I possibly can. It's just how I'm wired. And I've been this way for as long as I can remember, right? To when I was just a little shaver because I've always given a crap. And I mean, this is the point. I come out here to give, not to get. Buy from me, don't buy from me. Join the black card. Don't join the black card. I none of this matters to me. You do realize I've been doing this. I had somebody say, "Well, yeah, you're just coming out here pedalling your stuff." You know, I came out here for 200 plus episodes without selling a thing. Nothing. And even now, I don't come out here and go, "But wait, there's more." And let me like I'm not a Shamwow commercial. I'm a I actually give a crap about human humanity and mankind and it frightens me because I have two children and they matter to me. I have a wife who I adore. And I think if they would ever get in the hands of the medical world, the medical industrial complex, they'd be screwed. And people go, "Well, didn't a medical doctor save your life?" Yeah, God did. Told him what to do. You can take it any way you want. It doesn't matter to me what you think of me. It matters what I think of me. But yeah, absolutely. doctor took out my lung, took out the tumor, saved my life, I'm still here, but I know I have a purpose, and it's to make sure that none of you guys have the same screw-ups. If you can avoid every mistake I've ever made and have the health that I have right now at 52, you're winning. You're winning. Instead of contesting it and going, "Well, yeah, but you're like this because, how about you go, well, yeah, you're like this because, and how do I do it?" I don't know any different. If I s find somebody that's doing better than me, I don't contest them and go, "Well, you're doing better because I go, you're doing better. How'd you do that?" See, I need to take notes, man. I guess I was raised differently to look for solutions and go, how do I apply those solutions to my life? My job isn't here to argue with people. It's juvenile as hell. It's to provide information and then you decide. I don't know. Maybe I'm a librarian. That's it. I mean, that's what's in my head. I'm just a little cranky old librarian. Bald bearded librarian instead of a doctor. But your doctor isn't. Listen to me. I'll give you the three peptides and I'll say this is what you do and this is why they're so epic and why they'll change your life and it's the biggest bang for you. If you had to choose any three, any three, these are the three with and without hesitation. Not and I've talked about my three favorites and all this, but these are the three biggest bang for your buck, push you the furthest, extend your life the most, solve the most problems possible for a couple hundred bucks every month. Like that's it. You guys spend that going out for dinner and buying booze. So, you really should think about what you're doing and go, "What does this give me?" The ability to do all the things you want to do and probably solve most of your life problems. Your doctor isn't a mechanic, man. He's not. He's a guy who rents you cans of of fix a flat while ignoring the fact that your engine is torched and on fire and your transmission is on the road down there. You want health, not health care. And those terms have become synonymous and they're not. You want health. I'm talking the actual state of being. And if that's the case, then you need to stop treating symptoms and start rewriting the underlying code that your body functions on. And that requires understanding three very fundamental system failures, which I talk about all the time that I have come up with, nobody else. So somebody's like, "Oh, he's talking about it, too. Then you stole it from me." Which is totally fine. Steal all my stuff. You should. You should steal all of it. Just make sure you put this phrase in whatever you're stealing. But these are three fundamental system failures that lead to every single chronic disease that you are trying to avoid. Crippling insulin resistance, runaway systemic inflammatory processes, and catastrophic cellular energy bankruptcy. That's it. Solve those three and you become a juggernaut. These three peptides solve those three problems, which means you don't have to chase. The reason I'm telling you this is you don't have to chase down how do I solve this problem. You solve the foundation and the problem solves itself and then the problem just goes away for the most part. That's how the system works. I'm not talking about managing any of these problems. I'm talking about solving these problems, right? The insulin resistance, the inflammation, the energy issue. I'm talking about solving the problems. Three molecules, the biggest ROI on a limited health budget that you will ever see. Redatride, BPC 157, and TB500. This ain't some stack. This is a systemic overhaul for your physiology, your biology. And the heavyweight of the entire group, by the way, is Redat of True Tide. And people hear that and they're like, "Oh, here we go. It's weight loss." No, you guys have heard [sighs] Oz Peak and Monuro and WGO and all this stuff. Those are the noisy, irritating neighbors that you can't wait to go away. Red True Tide is this, it's this little quiet genius that came in quietly and bought the whole block. unimolecular triple agonist GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors. It hits all three here. Let me explain what that means. It doesn't just tap one system. It doesn't give it a little nudge. It recalibrate calibrates your entire metabolic system. Let me explain how important this really is because the weight loss, the thing everybody obsesses about with with Reda, is the least interesting thing that it does. It's almost a side effect. It's like a happy accident. Oops, I actually lost some weight. But let me explain what it really fixes because this stuff is so mindblowing. There is a reason why I will never stop taking Reddit true tide ever. And if you go, "Well, that's why you're so shredded." Dude, I take so much. And I I just ate three pieces of pizza, probably about two dozen cookies that my wife made this morning. No kidding. Chocolate chip cookies, and I'm drinking my fourth coffee of the day, and it is not even 2:00. I stack calories in my system. I just work really hard. Red True Diet doesn't change my appetite. whatsoever. I'm taking it for the longevity aspect. You'll see why. Let me explain this. Because if I had to take these three for the rest of my life and I wasn't and I was limited financially and and this is all I could get, I would never ever ever stop these ever. By the way, none of this is meant to treat, diagnose, cure, prescribe, triage. It's not meant to do anything other than give you a hypothetical, entertaining, and educational viewpoint on stuff. None of this is accurate or medical advice by the fact that I've been a doctor for decades. It's a weird world we live in that I have to preface everything with that. I'm just going to say if you pull up, listen to me. If you pull up 2023 phase 2 trial data, uh, New England Journal of Medicine, and if you guys don't read it, you should. It's actually worth it. Some of it's pretty technical, but there's some pretty wild stuff in there. Look past the weight column in this study. Look at hippatic steattosis, fatty liver disease, reversed 86% of subjects. 86. Let that land. I'll wait. Let that land. Not managed. No drugs reversed ALT and A enzymes normalized HBA1C cratered to non-diabetic levels averaging about 5.2%. That is that's a monster. And the re, by the way, no medicine, no pharmaceuticals, lipid panel, LDL and triglycerides tank. Absolutely plummet and HDL goes through the roof. This is a cardiovascular risk profile that's been completely rewritten. No medication, none. But here, here it gets even better. The neurological repair, this is where it gets scary good. So the hypothalamus, this is so wild. The hypothalamus is your metabolic control center for your system. Just put that in your brain for a second. In obesity, in insulin resistance, it becomes inflamed and leptin resistant. It's like the thermostat in your house is broken. So now it's screaming for heat while the furnace is melting. Redat truth tide crosses the bloodb brain barrier and fixes the thermostat not the furnace. So it restores hypothalamic leptin sensitivity massive. And this is why the weight stays off. The system is reprogrammed and reset. This hypothalam this hypothalamic repair it has probably some of the most profound downstream effects you can imagine. Because if you look at Alzheimer's and I've talked about this before, Alzheimer's and dementia and they say Alzheimer's only. I'm going to say Alzheimer's and dementia. Type three diabetes for a reason. That's why they call it this. And I know that dementia is not included technically in this. It should be. It should absolutely be because it's the same damn thing. It's destroying your system. This is what bugs me about Bruce Willis because he is savable 100%. 100%. And you know what the medical doctors do and the medical world do? They get in the way and they plug anyone around anyone with a disease with a bunch of empty facts and lies and big words and try and sound smart and then they dismiss. Anyone that discounts any other any alternative method outside of big pharma, you should question because there are so many ways to heal problems, big pharma is not one of them. So listen to me. Type three diabetes, Alzheimer's and dementia. Just categorize them the same. Insulin resistance in the brain creates amalloid plaques and neuropibrillary tangles. It's it's a brain energy crisis. So by by restoring central insulin sensitivity, redatride isn't just preventing early onset dementia. It's creating a neuroprotective environment. The weight loss is just the visible tip of a very massive physiological iceberg. That's why this is such a big deal. That's why this is one of the biggest bangs for your buck. You're not taking it. And that's the problem is it's being marketed so much for weight loss. But it does so much more than that. Is an oops. That's all it is. It's an oops. Let me And how about this? I'm going to gut the competition, too, because I'm tired of people going, "Well, I took semiglutide. I took Ters appetite and it's way better. And if you go, that's condescending and berating and arrogant and irritated. I don't know what to tell you, man. I am not changing who I am for you just so your fragile little body and mind go, "Oh my god, he's hurting my feelings. You're an adult." Listen to the facts. Apply the facts. Have a better damn life. Grow up. Somebody made a comment says, "Oh, he's always on these rants." Yeah, because you want all, you know, people want the information and they never want to apply it. They just want more just consumers of information but doing nothing about it. So I'm going to gut the competition. I'm going to gut the medical doctors. I'm going to gut big pharma and specifically semiglutide enters epatide. Single and dual agonists. They are it's like taking a pillow to a fist fight. Just a waste. They cause one I don't care what you tell me. The facts are the facts. They're irrefutable. Significant lean muscle loss. You lose muscle 100% of the time. Just take a DEXA scan. It proves it. the very tissue that burns the calories and regulates metabolism. You are losing leads to nutritional deficiencies. There's no lawsuit against reatide. It's against all the other stuff. They don't address the problem is these neither one of these guys address the semiglutite. Address the glucagon axis which is critical for energy expenditure and liver function. They manage a number on a damn scale which is what sells a product while your body composition and underlying health disintegrate. It's a it's a peric victory. Retatrutide with its glucagon agonism preserves lean mass and increases energy expenditure. It solves the problem. It doesn't just cover it up or change the number on a scale. You guys have to understand this. So here you go. Check one box. Remember big three problems. Check one. Problem one is metabolic dysfunction solved. Red or true tide solved. But your body is still this battlefield of micro injuries and wear and tear and silent inflammatory processes and all these issues. So, here comes BPC-157. Probably the coolest peptide second to red tide because this thing, oh man, it's a piece of protein that you guys, you already know, found in gastric juice. If you don't, now you know. But no, you cannot take it or ever. Never works. You can argue all you want. You can say these guys make one that does work. It's not possible. It's not possible. It's not possible. It's not possible. Physiology and chemistry, practical biochemistry will disagree 24/7, 365. It is a set of instructions that when you inject BPC157, all of these are injected. Subq, you are sending a a text message that contains the repair manual to every cell in your body, every one of them. And what's wild is the mechanism is breathtakingly elegant. It accelerates angioenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels. It upregulates something called VEGF and the nitric oxide system. So, it brings oxygen and nutrients to damaged areas. It cycle it it siphons off toxins and metabolic waste from the same area. So it puts the good in and takes the bad away. It modulates the TGF beta pathway. So it controls inflammation and it promotes tissue regen instead of scar tissue formation. Well, all of these things are great things, but if you're running this 24/7, 365, all your system does is improve. You're like the bionic freaking man. Just get specific. The blood and brain barrier is comprised of Oh, it doesn't matter what it's comprised of. The blood brain barrier is been compromised from years of inflammation and poor diet. Just trust me, it has. You know what BPC does? Upregulates tight junction proteins like Z1 and Oclutin. It reseals the barrier, the bloodb brain barrier, which just so you know is critically important. It's right up there with the the gut barrier. Tight junction proteins again, go figure with zulin, right? Uh 2020 study in Frontiers and Pharmarmacology showed it mitigated brain edema. Listen to me. This is so wild. Mitigated brain edema and neuronal damage after a TBI. Traumatic brain injuries. Where do you see the medical world just filling people up with BPC57 after a TBI? Where? Where? Just tell me anybody in the comments. Tell me where do you where have you seen this? Non-stop. You don't. You don't because it's cheap and it doesn't make money. You guys have to understand you are being played so hard and it really bothers me. You guys are just being lied to non-stop and I'm probably the only person out here telling about it. There's lots of people trying to copy me and make AI versions of me. It ain't me. I'm telling the truth about what this is. People just trying and even that that's a disgusting thought. Think about that. Think about what I just said. You're trying to profit off of me instead of actually caring about the person. You're going, "How do I make money off the person?" But feain caring. Anyone copying me probably doesn't even know what the word feain means. Look at the cardiovascular system with BPC57. Endothelial damage is the root of atherosclerosis. BPC-157 promotes endothelial cell survival and migration. So it repairs the lining of your blood vessels that are originally full of velcro because of all the bad decisions and poor things that have gone through your system. Look at your kidneys. Downregulates pro fiibrotic markers. It's this is all researchbased. It protects against glomearulos sclerosis. Look at the liver. Reduces oxidative stress, fibroic markers in hepatitis and cerosis. The things that destroy and demolish your system. You can't live without your liver. By the way, waiting for a liver transplant, not fun. My dad died of endstage liver disease. I don't take it as a joke at all. I miss my dad every day and he he was 67 when he passed away. If you followed me for any time, you already know that. But I still miss my dad every day. It's been 13 years. You think for a second I don't miss my dad and he would have been here had I known what I know now. You guys need to take what I'm saying seriously. Look at joints and arthritis. You guys crippled in pain taking ridiculous medications and handfuls of Tylenols. Man, this thing's a regenerative wrecking ball. Upregulates collagen formation. It it works better than GHKCU, copper, and copper is gangster. But BPC-157 upregulates collagen formation, stimulates fibroblasts, and condraight migration, creates this incredibly potent anti-inflammatory environment right at the sight of injury. This isn't pain management. This is 100% structural repair. It's hands down the most potent systemic repair compound we know of. And you will never see it in a hospital ever. Not here in North America, ever. It addresses How many problems do I have? Three. Stay with me. There are three problems. This is problem two. Chronic inflammation and tissue degradation. Remember what I said? Insulin, inflammation, energy. Those three things. Solve those. Your entire biological world, your ecosystem runs at $6 million man levels. Like you are Lee Majors. And if you don't know who Lee Majors is, I'm not going to fault you. I'm 52. But Lee Majors is a stud. But watch. If BPC is what's sending out the text messages with the repair manuals, right? Then the last one, TB500. Remember Reddit, True Tide, BPC, and TB500 is all the trucks and the moving crew and the workers that move materials to the job site and does all the heavy lifting. That's what TB500 is. Excuse me. Its primary mechanism above all else, but this is probably one of my favorite peptides. And there's a couple of reasons, and I'll tell you one that blows my mind. Its primary mechanism is regulating actin. Now, actin, this is the protein that forms the cellular cytokeleton. Actin is the skeleton of every single cell you've got. TB500 binds to actin monomers and prevents their polymerization which allows cells to remain mobile and flexible. So this makes it the master regulator of cell migration. This matters because it's going to send cells. The easier your body can send a cell to solve a problem at the site of injury, the faster the injury gets repaired. Does that make sense? So this is not theoretical by the way. This is I mean look at this is my favorite. This is why I told you heart repair postMI myocardial inffection heart attack right a damaged heart muscle 100% of the time forms scar tissue cardommyioytes need to migrate to this site and a new vascule needs to form in order to reverse that it does not happen they have written that off saying it's not possible you ready for this if you're not sitting down sit down TB500 is chemotactic for endothelial cells and stem cells what that means is it brings the repair crew to the exact latitude and longitude the coordinates of the damage one. It improves injection fraction by promoting functional tissue repair over functional scar over nonfunctional scar tissue. It tells your heart repair the stuff. The most mind-blowing thing I just said in this entire podcast is how it repairs heart damage. And it's probably the one thing most people will miss. It'll repair your cornea, your eye. The epithelium needs to slide across the surface to heal a wound. Just follow me on this. TB500 facilitates this act independent migration. 100% act independent. Can't do it without it. It the healing I'll go over some of this healing because the numbers are astounding. Remarkably accelerated. Again, you are like Wolverine. This isn't just for athletes with tendon tears. This is every cell in your body that has lost its ability to move and repair effectively. Never mind anti-inflammatory properties. It downregulates. I talk about this a lot. NFCappa B which is going to it's the precursor to the subsequent cytoine storm and it promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory L10 and the building blocks of extracellular matrix like lamine and fibonnectin and all the things that that solve the problem. TB500 solves problem three which is low cellular energy and poor cell mobility. It gets the workers to the site effectively and gives them the dang tools to solve the problem. Listen, [sighs and gasps] I'll make it really easy. TB I'll give you the cliff notes of TB500 because I got a little deep in that. Sorry, but I want you to understand this. TB500 when it enters your system via injection only directly binds to the actin monomers. I said this already. Facilitates cell movement migration to the injury sites. Heart repair after myioardial inffection. Follow me on this. I wanted to give you a number. 43% improvement in ejection fraction. Research-based. None of this is I think I'm going to just make up a number today. Corial repair, which I talked about, fixes the eye. Complete epithelial regeneration in 72 hours. Systemic inflammation. I'll keep on going. NFCAPPA down regulation while increasing anti-inflammatory IL10 turns off inflammation inside of 45 minutes. Connect the dots. Just connect the dots with me. The medical lie is that a disease is a deficiency of pharmaceuticals, right? High cholesterol, statin deficiency, high blood pressure, ACE inhibitor deficiency. This is insanity. That doesn't even make sense. The truth is disease is a state of biology that has gone vastly arry. The three core biological failures are always the same. Insulin resistance. Your cells are deaf to the hormone that tells them to take in energy. Systemic inflammatory process. Your body is in constant lowgrade war with itself damaging the hell out of your tissues. Low ATP production. Your cellular power plants, the little mitochondria, are broken. So you have no energy to function or repair. You know who thought this up? Me. Dr. Trevor Bachmire. Nobody else has put this together. And I'm doing it because I want you guys to understand where the problem is so you can just solve it on your own so you don't even need me. I I want you like I'm the doctor that goes, "How do I make sure you can fire me? I'm trying to make sure that you can fire me as fast as possible." That's so weird. The doctor's like, "I want you to need me. I need my ego stroked. I don't want my ego stroked. I want you to never need me." That you just go, "Man, this guy gave me the answers. I'm a juggernaut now." Edit True Tide directly solves problem number one. BPC57 directly solves problem two and TB500 directly solves problem three and accelerates the repair that becomes possible once one and two are handled. This isn't about a 12week cycle. The concept of cycling health is a relic of the performance enhancement world. This is not these aren't to be cycled. Health span and longevity are a commitment. This is about maintaining a physiological state where disease processes hold on can't gain a foothold in your biology. It's about sustaining insulin sensitivity and controlling inflammatory processes in your body and maximizing the cellular energy production for decades upon decades upon decades. The research on long-term peptide use for longevity is astounding. It's because the mechanistic rationale is irrefutable. You're pro listen, you're providing a very precise signaling that your body needs. It's not a drug demanding it does it outside of homeostasis. It's what it needs to maintain itself optimally, signaling that declines with age and disease and without managing the three core problems. The old model is completely bankrupt. It offers you a slower dec decline. It's manage decline, manage decay. Think of this. If you think of this as a new paradigm, a repair to reclaim the biological vitality that is your birth rate. You are born with this. You are taught that you are some weird way. You are property and the doctors own you and they tell you what to do. Really think about it. You go to the doctor. When you don't listen to the doctor, they get mad at you. How is that even possible? You are your own individual human being. If you think for a second that a doctor has a right to tell you what to do, you can happily tell them go right to hell. This is your body. But your birthright is biological vitality and just absolute robust physiology. So you can con you can keep on paying the subscription fee on all your diseases and your sicknesses. You can. I I'm not here to tell you what to do, man. Uh, personally, I would invest everything I've got into the fundamentals of my health because I love being alive. I love doing things. I love being able to come out here. I love that my brain works, that I can come up with solutions, that I can deliver them to you guys because I genuinely give a crap about you because I want you to have everything so you can keep on stacking wins and you never need me. Cuz if I make you rely on me, then I am exactly like all the rest of them. I refuse to do that. I want you to never need me. I don't gatekeep a dang thing, man. I give you every ounce of information, everything that's inside this cabbage here, this dome that I walk around sporting my head, all the knowledge that I've spent years and years and years putting together and more that I keep going. I comb through research every day and then decipher it and put it together and come out here and do this. You think these podcasts are easy? I have to actually make sure that all right, I think this was the study and that was the study and then I put them together so you guys understand. But even then, it doesn't matter about the studies. It matters that I give you the information, which thank God I've spent 30 years making sure I know because I care. The science is here. Mechanisms are here and they're clear. They're clear as glass. The muddy part are your choices. You have to decide. Anyway, I hope you got something out of this. Those are the big three injectables. I'm going to do a big three on orals coming up next. I'll probably do that one tomorrow. The big three orals that you can take. Anyway, I'll talk to you later. Never miss.
