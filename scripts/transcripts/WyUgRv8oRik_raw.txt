January 1st, 2026. Happy New Year everybody. I hope you guys were safe and you had a fantastic night. You started off your day properly. You kept your word to yourself and you are doing all the things that you said you were going to do yesterday. I don't do New Year's resolutions. I also don't crap on anybody's New Year's resolutions. I just I set targets all the time. So, it doesn't matter that it's a day. But whatever you've decided to do, I hope it is epic. I hope you stick to it and I hope you just nail every one of those targets just the most savage way. So today I'm going to talk about cuz everybody's beenounding me and I'll take it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing about Reddit True Tide. So I'm getting a lot. You guys have got to stop listening to the Reddit forums and the Kora forums and the Insta Bros and the Insta experts and honestly 99% of the docs who claim expertise that are just shills for the pharmaceutical company. You guys got to you guys got to take it. You need to claim sovereignty of your biology. You really do. And I don't know how else to say it other than that. I'm not I'm not here to crap on somebody, but I'm here to give you the information. And if somebody argues with me in my comments, honestly, grow up. Just go listen to someone else. I don't have any time for you. I'm never going to respond to you. And if it makes you feel better to be a toddler like that, I guess good on you. But I'm going to explain everything about Redat True Tide, including what to do with it and why micro dosing can't work. It's not even designed. The engineers didn't even design it for that. So to claim that more than the engineers that built this thing, that is just ignorance in its greatest form. I don't know what else to say. You guys need to stop thinking better than the people that engineered this. It's not designed to be micro dosed whatsoever. And I'll address the side effects. I'll explain everything from A to Z. Just need to you just have to have some patience. Patience is not a virtue. It's a precondition for understanding what I'm going to tell you in this entire podcast. So just be patient. Listen listen to me. You guys believe you live in a free country. Man, I even it's wild even saying that because that's not how this works. Like it's not. Managed decline is the killer. Like you believe you own your body and you believe you lived in you live in a free country and you are wrong on both accounts. Watch your body is a company. It is a publicly traded company and for your entire life you've been this minority shareholder. Look at your life. Look at just stop before you think superficially. Just stop and listen. I'm right. You've been a minority shareholder of your own biology. The board of directors, that's a cabal of food lobbies and pharmaceutical executives and regulatory agencies who have a vested interest in your company performing poorly. Their business model is your managed decline, right? The revenue is your sickness. Really put that together. You need to, I don't know, stage a coup or a hostile takeover of your own biology and your own mindset and psychology so you can actually do something with your life. This is why I come out here so you just have the info. So look at Red True Tide. This isn't and if you're like, "Okay, this is great. It's going to be a talk about weight loss." No, it's not. Weight loss is the lint you find in your pocket after you've won the lottery. It's a tright loss and red truth tide. It is a trivial side effect of a fundamental biological recalibration. To understand it, you need to forget everything that you think you know about pharmarmacology. All of you guys. And if you're one of these Insta expert, Insta bros that are coming here just to crap on me, maybe maybe pull your head out of your butt and pay attention to the guy who just happens to know a little more than you, who wants to share it. I'm not crapping on you. I'm giving you the information for free that people have had to go to college for a decade to learn. I've done it already. I'm just giving it to you. I'm not asking you for quarter million dollars in tuition. I'm just coming out here giving you the info. Listen, Reddit True Tide is not a drug. No matter what people try, it's a drug. No, it's not. Drugs force. Peptides are signals. They tell your body to do what it already does. It is a master regulator. It's a key to your own metabolic operating system. So, here's what it is. The pharmaceutical industry spent two decades and billions of dollars chasing singleaction compounds, peptides, drugs, etc. They and they ended up creating something called semiglutide. Tzepathide is a dual action compound. It's still worthless. But semiglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, right? It's this one trick pony. It tells your brain that you're full and then they market it as this miracle, but it's not. It's a crutch. Red True Tide isn't even in the same league. But let me explain it because if you follow me from A to Z, you will go, "Holy crap, now I understand how it is." Because I think nobody's really, in fact, I've listened to probably well over a hundred different podcasts and explanations and bro science people trying to explain, right? None of you guys are getting it right. So, it's this unlecular single chain peptide engineered to be a triple agonist. It binds to and activates three separate receptors simultaneously, GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. But independently that receptor agonism is not the same as when you're doing them at the same time. And just adding glucagon isn't it's adding glucagon with GLP1 and GIP that makes it phenomenal. It's not the glucagon. So when I see these guys coming out with bioglutide and we're going to add even more to it. You're missing the point and you're not understanding endocrinology and pharmarmacology whatsoever and how your system works. So I'm trying to give you this information. So, let me decode everything and I'm going to do it without a bunch of kindergarten baby language. If it's I had somebody go, "Let me dumb down Dr. Trevor Bachmire." Why? Just educate up. Just educate up, man. Stick around. I promise you'll learn something. I promise. Look at GLP1. When you eat, this is how it works, right? Glucagon like peptide 1 is what it stands for. When you eat, your gut releases this. It's the postprandial satiety and insulin secretion signal, right? Tells your pancreas, okay, we have incoming glucose. Release insulin to deal with all of this. And it tells your brain, hey man, listen, the tank is full. Stop eating. Single agonists like semaglutide mimic this. It's it's not really that useful because it causes a bunch more problems. Yeah. People go, I lost all this weight. Listen, there was something called the HCG diet where you ate 500 calories a day and took droppers that allegedly did this magic and you w lost weight too, but you looked like a melted candle. That's not Listen, you're so obsessed about the number on the scale. You're not caring about how you get there and what it's costing you to get there and the longevity afterwards. Lo that number. It's like the HBA1C. It is not just drugging that number down actually has massive catastrophic effects. Metformin actually causes more problems than it solves by far. I've proven this so many times. Research proves it. They just don't give you that part. They tell you the snippet that it's but in this 1.1% it actually worked and the other 98% it destroyed people's lives. So just keep that in mind when you're listening to me. EIP is the next one. Glucose dependent insulinotropic polyeptide. This is the you could call it an overly genius. It's pretty wild. Released from the upper intestine. It also stimulates insulin secretion but the magic is in atapost tissue. So 2018 molecular metabolism showed that GIP receptor agonism what this is why you got to understand this part when combined with GLP1 enhances insulin sensitivity in fat cells makes your fat cells more metabolically flexible less inflammatory more functional it's the and also process this energy efficiently signal does that make sense now glucagon this is where the entire system goes tits up the paradigm shatters because watch because alone this is Why you have to understand why things work together and why they work independently. GLP1 gip just stand alone. Sorry, something in my eye. Stand alone do their thing. Glucagon stand alone does something radically different than when it is combined with GLP1 and GIP. This is why it's so wild. Alone, glucagon is the fasting hormone, right? It tells your liver, hey, we need energy. Break down glycogen and release glucose. Like now let's go. We're going to die. So in a diabetic for example this is broken. Glucagon is inappropriately high dumping sugar into an already flooded system. The pharmaceutical orthodoxy saw glucagon as the enemy to be suppressed. The engineers of reatride saw an opportunity for a thermodynamic hack because they understand endocrinology and human biology. What if, watch, what if you could hijack the glucagon signal in the presence of very powerful GLP-1 and GIP activity which powerfully suppresses appetite ready for this part? And controls blood glucose. The glucagon agonism is forced to find another outlet. It can't function the way because it's being blocked. It can't effectively raise blood sugar because the GLP-1 GIP activity is creating this powerful counterregulatory environment. Now, does this make sense? What does it do? It dumps its energy into thermogenesis. That's why this is such a big deal. So all these people arguing about semaglutide and tzepide. You're arguing from a platform that's built on a bunch of crepe paper. It this is why the argument is so ridiculous when you guys get in and you're like semiglutide and tzepide were way better. I'm so disappointed that you're cra trash cr trash crashing on them. They're garbage. Don't get mad at me because the product you used is gar I don't care if you lost the weight. I can starve you out. Listen, go on the show alone for make it a 100 days, you'll be scrawny. Go on Survivor and let Jeff Probes put you through the ringer and you'll be scrawny. You're looking for something to justify why what you took solved your problem. But it didn't really solve your problem. It hit it. And most people, the number is well over 70% by the way that take semiglutide blow up when they're done because your body goes bananas trying to fight everything that you just did and it goes the opposite direction. Hard. There's research everywhere. I'm not going to sit here and quote all these studies, but I try and give you as much as I can, but follow me. This is why you have to understand why Reddit True Tide is they're gunning for this hard, man. Because it does such incredible things. It dumps, like I said, it dumps its energy into thermogenesis in the presence only of GLP1 and GIP. It doesn't do that on the other side of that equation because like I said, it tells your liver, I need energy. Break down glycogen. Release the glucose, which is not what you want except right now when you're getting in the way and not allowing it to flood your bloodstream. Glucagon receptor activation in the liver stimulates something called a denylate cycles. It increases cyclic AM C activates protein kynise A, which then phosphorolates this cascade of enzymes. This cranks up hippatic glycolysis and crucially fatty acid oxidation. It's like hitting a metabolic afterburners in your F20. Your liver becomes this fat incinerating furnace. But this isn't theory. 2021, it is 2026 today. So this is a lot of years ago, 2021. New England Journal of Medicine phase two trials demonstrated this with brutal efficiency. But this is the part everybody doesn't like. 24.2% 2% mean reduction in body weight at the highest dose over 48 weeks of which 70% was from fat. Semaglutide and tzepide can't even come close to that number. Not the weight loss, the fact that it was from fat. They demolish your tissue from A to Z. Listen, the results of this study were so unequivocally superior to the placebo that they were using that continuing the trial was deemed unethical. You guys don't get it. The old model of obesity treatment is being declared obsolete because they're making they've been making mistakes for so long. And yes, I get it. The primary way to look at this is how about you just don't get fat. Being overweight is a decision. Yes, I agree. Unless there's some real genuine metabolic problem. I just I've seen well over a million patients now and I deal with people like in the black card. Just so you know, I'll go right to the peptide. You want to get your stuff? You want to buy from Elite Biogenics? Awesome. I'll break my fingers to make sure that my company serves you as best as it can. I really will. And everything that comes from my labs, my house, my machine, I would give to my wife and kids. You know how many other companies I can say that about? None. And some of them I don't know. But no other company with a lab I will ever trust with that. I sure as hell am trusting some compounding pharmacy bought by big pharma who god knows what they're putting in or people buying preconstituted peptides. What are you nuts? They're so fragile. You may as well put a baby in a box and mail it to somebody and cross your fingers that it survives. That's how ridiculous that is. And yet people go, I just don't want to. It's like really hard to rec blends. That's another one. I saw somebody make a post about blends and how they're not a big deal. That's how research is run all the time. Not a chance. Research is not run at all using blends. Never. You know why? Because you lose control. Where's your control when you use a blend? Have you ever done a research study if you're the person that said that? None. I've done hundreds of them. So, the reason I'm telling you this and I'm giving you all this information and I'm pretty passionate about it is cuz I want you to have the damn information. So, just get this now. Here's the problem. Micro I got to address this. I wasn't even going to talk about it but as much as I'm going to, but I'm going to light this up because the micro doing fallacy, the pharmacocinetic illiteracy is mindboggling. The internet biohackers they listen they hear about this red tide and their first thought is I'm smarter than the scientists who designed it. I'm going to micro dose daily because the side effects it'll be better. That's not innovation. It's pharmarmacological malpractice. And you guys it's ignorance. It's ignorance. You don't have to trust me. But I've got no I got no vested interest in this. None. Like I said you want to buy from elite. Awesome. You don't go buy from someone else. Awesome. You knock yourself out. What I have is a vested interest in mankind. That's the same reason why I came out with a black card. The black card. I have so many people in the black card telling me how it's the greatest thing they've ever done. Do you know how much that means to me? I don't do it for me. I do it because I'm tired of people not getting the answers that they so desperately need and getting bros scienced into taking a bunch of nonsense because they're listening to some imbecile with a PhD who really has no concept of how human biology functions or some CEO that just wants your money. I don't care. I need you, if you're listening to this, I need you to understand this so you can make an educated decision and actually have a physiology that's like a juggernaut. Like some of my closest friends are multi multi-millionaires and billionaires who trust me. And it doesn't matter. It could be a mom next door who makes 10 grand a year. It's not why I'm just saying these are people that could choose anybody. and they choose me because they trust my information more than anyone else's because they know I'm out here giving a crap. It's the same reason why I have the black card. Listen, if you want to join the black card, just so you know, I gave it two extra days because everybody freaked out that they couldn't get to the bank fast enough to make it in before the price went up to 25 grand. And this is this was off the hip yesterday because I went, "Nope, not a chance." It is $9,997. Today is January 1st. $25,000, two grand a month to maintain. That's what it is. However, I have at least three dozen emails from people going, I couldn't get to the bank in time. I couldn't get the wire out in time to make the cut off to make it for 10 to get in for 10 grand. You got till the end of the day tomorrow. Till the wire cut off tomorrow, I'm not going to extend it anymore. But I'm trying to give you guys a way in. So, if you want and you're listening to this and you want in the black card, you have till tomorrow to get in at last year's investment before it is more than it's 2.5 times the price. And rightfully, just so you know, I have no problem with that. None. And I the black card is my live Q&A every Monday evening. I stay on and I solve your problems. It's access to me. Yes. via messaging through the VIP community that only and it's the entire protocol library that I put together, but that's not even the big deal. I'll you send me whatever labs questions this I have people that have been through doctors so many times and they finally came to me and they go, "Holy crap, it's the first time I've ever had results." Do you have any idea how much that matters to me? I care, man. I care. And if I don't know what and if you go if you care so much, how come you charge money? Because my time is more expensive than anything else because I don't get more of it. So, you're damn well going to compensate me for it cuz I can't bank my time. And if you think that is a bad statement, you don't like it, then you don't value your time either. Because if I can pay somebody to give me the answer inside of 2 days that I've been chasing or 3 days, whatever. And the answer I've been chasing, the relief I've been chasing, the solution I've been chasing has been 10 years and I still don't have it. Well, you bet your ass I'm going to write that check. I'm going to swipe that card. I'm going to wire that money like this. So apply atunlockthecard.com is how you get the wire information and the sheet, not just the account and the routing that shows up on the website. You get the whole sheet cuz a lot of places need an address and all that stuff, which is fine. I use I'm not I'm here in Texas. I use Frost. And I'm very transparent about everything. But if you want in, here's your window. So if all of you guys are saying, "Oh, I couldn't make it." Now's your chance. Put up or shut up. I'm closing this little window here. cut off my recording yet again. Heads up, we made a new recording track. I don't know what is a deal with Riverside FM. It's done this two days in a row now. It's starting to piss me off. So, if you guys have something that runs as good, don't tell me Streamyard cuz it doesn't. But if you have something that runs better than Riverside FM for a podcast platform to record and do all the things it does and clean it up and get the static and noise out of the audio and etc., tell me. Somebody send me an email. I don't need something complicated. So, if you're super complicated or you're trying to sell me your production services, I don't want them I have somebody that does all that already. I just need a recording platform. So, don't try and sell me the fact that you have this great service that you provide cuz I will just say no. I'm just asking any of you guys in my audience that if you're like, "Hey, yeah, this is a great platform for recording podcast. It's wicked." So, you tell me. Anyway, I'm asking you guys for help for once, man. All right. So, the biohackers, the insta bros, that's where I was, right? I'm smarter than the scientists. No, you're not. You're not. Look it, just hang with me for a second. Just hang with me for a second. Redatride has a plasma half-life of about 6 to 7 days. But it's not an accident. It's by design. It's deliberately engineered through fatty acid side chain conjugation to be like this. The structure promotes strong reversible binding to albumin, which is the most abundant protein in your blood. This it's like this on purpose. This creates a slow release reservoir while maintaining a stable therapeutic plasma concentration for a week after a single injection. The goal is steadystate receptor engagement. Period. Look at something as simple as I have to I guess I can't even say it because I'll get pinched. It's wicked. This thing that comes from the tobacco leaf. Really? I that's I've been pinched for say. How ridiculous is that in my free country? Okay. something that comes from the tobacco leaf in and of itself. Slow infusion like from this, the chance of you being hooked on this for life is pretty much zero. The hard sharp hit mixed with pyroines and everything else through inhalation. My god, that's why it's a you guys don't unpack that. So, I'm trying to give you the information. Same thing with this long steadystate receptor engagement eliminates most of the problems. So watch micro doing daily is it's like trying to heat your house by flicking a lighter on and off every five minutes and you're in a 10,000 square foot home. You get this brief spike of heat right around the lighter. It's very tiny in effective receptor activation, right? Followed by a cold trough, just the rapid clearance of human physiology. You never achieve the sustained thermal mass needed to warm the damn house. I don't know why you're getting mad and you're going wrong. Just because you do it doesn't mean it's right. That's the systemic metabolic shift required, by the way, is what I'm trying to explain. I'm just using a metaphor. What you do end up achieving when you micro dose is constant erratic signaling to the entire receptor. Then you're not treating the system, you're pissing it off, you're annoying it. This is a perfect recipe for inducing receptor desensitization and tolerance, which is why some of you guys are taking 8 to 10 milligrams a week. What the hell is wrong with you? The sweet spot is four. You're training your body to ignore the very signal you're trying to amplify and you're doing it yourself because of your own ignorance. The pharmacocinetics are very clear. Stable weekly dosing builds the necessary concentration for therapeutic effect. Daily micro micro doing guarantees sub therapeutic erraticism. It's not clever. It's stupid. And I listen, I got nothing to gain. I don't have any money sitting in Eli Liy. I'm just trying to help you. And so listen, and the whole issue about the side effects and that my side effects went away when I micro dosed. Listen to me. Those horror stories that everybody hears. I took Rea and I was vomiting for days. Let me diagnose this for you. I'll help you. I will diagnose it right here for you. User error. Ignorance. Bro science error. Insta expert error. Listening to somebody that says, "Trust me, bro, because they have muscles." Listen to the person because they're an expert, not because they look like they're an expert. There's no person that actually cares about you not selling you a product and going trust me bro because their ego is so fragile. 2023 study by Jastrop it was the triumph trials specifically implicitly lists the adverse events in order. Nausea is first, vomiting is second. This is the hierarchy of how they occur. Diarrhea third and constipation fourth. I had some doctor try and tell me diarrhea was the number one side effect. No, it's not. And there's the research is everywhere proving that's not true. And by the way, these were overwhelmingly gastrointestinal and more importantly 100% dose related. Look at I'll explain the biology behind this. The GLP-1 receptor isn't just in your brain. It's all over your digestive tract. So when you take this super physiological dose, you are taking a wartthog and you are carpet bombing these receptors. You're telling your stomach to slow emptying to a glacial pace. You're overwhelming the system and the nausea and the vomiting aren't a sign of toxicity or that it didn't work for you. They are a very predictable dose dependent physiological response to overwhelming a signal pathway. It's your body's alarm system. It's a fire alarm system going off because you set the kitchen on fire with a dose 10 times higher than what you needed because you listened to some guy that went, "Trust me, bro. Here's my affiliate code." Taking more isn't brave. Taking more isn't helpful. Taking more isn't more efficient. Isn't faster. It's biologically illiterate. The therapeutic window exists for a reason. Friaking respect it. And listen, you want to know I'm Listen, I'm just trying to help you. You want to know why Reddit True Tide's so badass? Like I said, it's not it's not the weight loss. Look at the heart of the corruption. The biggest lie ever sold in medicine is that depression. It's the serotonin hypothesis largely pushed by pharmaceutical marketing law since the '9s. Just so you know, it's collapsing under the weight of its own evidence-free premise. Me, too. Molecular psychiatry, which analyzed decades of research, love this stuff, proved there is no consistent evidence of an association between serotonin and depression. None. Oh, believe me, this has everything to do with red tree time. So, what is depression? What is anxiety? They're symptoms. It's the check engine light for the three biological failures. Again, here they show up again. Where's my Nobel Prize? Look, systemic inflammation. Your brain is not this isolated building all on its own. It's connected to your body by this river of stuff called blood. Right? When you're obese, your visceral fat, listen, if you go, I'm I'm depressed and I'm not obese. Get out of my comments. Arguing the fringe is just the weakest form of argument. That's not Listen, just listen. Your visceral fat, that toxic inflammatory organ wrapped around your organs, pumps out a constant stream of pro-inflammatory cytoines, TNF, alpha, IL6, CRP, C reactive protein, right? Like these cytoines, they cross the bloodb brain barrier. 2015 meta analysis in Jamaa psychiatry confirmed that depressed patients have violently elevated levels of these inflammatory markers. Huh? These cytoines, listen, here's why it's important. These cytoines activate micro ga which are the brain's resident snipers. They're the immune cells and it turns them violently hostile. They attack synapses. They disrupt neurogenesis. They alter neurotransmitter metabolism. Your brain is literally under an inflammatory siege. But this isn't this isn't a metaphor, you guys. This is immunology 101. Basics. Basics. That's the first one. Look at the second one. Immune or insulin resistance in your brain specifically. Remember, I'm just talking about anxiety, depression, all that stuff, right? The brain is a glucose pig. It's just it's sucks. It takes all your glucose. It consumes about 20% of your body's energy. I've said this before. When neurons be when neurons become insulin resistant, a condition now famously called, I talked about this yesterday, type 3 diabetes, they cannot efficiently uptake glucose. They starve. 2017 journal of clinical investigation demonstrated that brain insulin resistance 100% impairs synaptic function and is the core core feature of Alzheimer's and dementia. The amaloid plaques and towagles that everybody talks about that's the debris that's the rubble from the disaster that happened already. The earthquake is a metabolic failure of the neuron. And look at ATP shortage. This is the third one. This is the final common pathway. Inflammation and insulin resistance [ __ ] mitochondria systemically. This is specifically within your neurons. These tiny little power plants, they can't produce sufficient ATP. So without energy, neurons can't maintain their membrane potentials. They can't fire properly. They can't repair themselves. They can't do anything right. So they enter this state of functional hibernation, which we experience as brain fog, anodonia, fatigue. 2018 Nature Reviews neuroscience proved the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and all depressive disorders. All of them. Oh, that's a pretty big umbrella to be under. Reddit truth eye, just so you know, is the targeted nuke that hits this entire thing. It shuts down inflammation. Watch. By rapidly ablating visceral fat, it removes the primary source of all those inflammatory cytoines. 2022 cell metabolism showed that the receptor agonism directly reduces macroofage infiltration into atapost tissue, shutting down the cytoine factory, but it does it at the source. It restores cerebral metabolism by reversing systemic insulin resistance. It improves glucose delivery to the brain. Further, the receptors are these receptors are densely packed in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. Activation of these receptors 2020 study in nature neuroscience showed it promotes synaptic plasticity reduces amaloid beta toxicity prevents talotangle formation encourages neurogenesis read a true tide doesn't just make you feel less sad and upset it fixes the underlying metabolic catastrophe that manifests as sadness it's not a weight loss peptide you guys why do you think they are trying to get rid of this from everybody and make you buy it from them because it threatens everything it is an existential threat I call it this all all the time. It resolves the energy crisis by improving mitochondrial efficiency and metabolic flexibility throughout the body. It ensures a very stable energy supply to the brain. A neuron with sufficient adenazine triphosphate ATP is a very resilient neuron. That's why benefits are so profound for neurodeenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, dementia. They all have very strong inflammatory and metabolic components. Red True Tide is systemic therapy for a systemic problem. Period. You're welcome. Yeah. This is how you start your new year, baby. Like this. Dropping bombs. Listen, look at Just talk money. Just My wife always says, and you know what? I love my wife. She is freaking smart, man. She is smart. She's hot. She's awesome. I just love the [ __ ] out of my wife. I just I could talk about her all day because I love her that much. She's awesome. But she always says, "Follow the money." She's right. That's what this is all about. Look at the global market for diabetes projected to be well over 100 billion by 2030. Alzheimer's treatments another hundred billion dollar market. Anti-depressants, antiscychotics, tens of billions more. The fatty liver disease drug pipeline is worth billions. This is managed decline. This is a subscription model of healthcare. A patient watch a patient with type 2 diabetes is a customer for life. They will buy metformin then a DPP4 inhibitor and insulin and statins for the cardiovascular disease that they now develop and the renal disease that's going to happen. Then they buy drugs for that kidney failure that follows. It's a revenue waterfall. Never mind the chemotherapy that's probably going to show up because of the fact that they are running at a destroyed biological system where all three failures are just happening at 100%. Anti-depressants are the perfect model, the perfect example of this corruption. They don't cure anything. They create dependency. And just so you know, the long-term effects are horrific. 2020 longitudinal study, Journal of Effective Disorders. That long-term SSRI use is 100% associated with weight gain, sexual dysfunction, no lead in a pencil, emotional blunting. You feel nothing. Do you not understand? This is what they're trying to do anyway. They manage a symptom while exacerbating the underlying metabolic rot that caused it in the first place. Redatride is a massive threat to this entire ecosystem. It's not a drug for a disease. It's not a peptide for a disease. It's a system reset for the root cause of all chronic diseases. A patient who takes RETA for a year, reverses their type 2 diabetes, loses their visceral fat, normalizes their inflammation is a customer lost not just for the diabetes drugs, but for the statins, the blood pressure meds, the potential Alzheimer's, dementia drugs that would have needed in 10, 15, 20 years. This is why the medical establishment is terrified. This is why you hear all people going, "Yeah, but what about this happened and there's a multi-billion dollar lawsuit because of that? It's a shell game. We need more long-term studies. That needs to be FDA approved. Are you out of your mind? That's the last organization that needs to approve anything. It's not about safety. The safety profile from the trials that you can look up everywhere is unfathomably clean for its efficacy. This is all about protecting a business model. The FDA is not a philanthropic organization. It is a political entity heavily influenced by the very industry that it regulates. A curative therapy is a direct threat to the quarterly earnings reports of every major pharmaceutical company on the planet. If you don't get it, that's just a cartel. You're blind and frankly stupid. The cancer risk scare stories that people keep talking about debunked 2018 cohort study in diabetes care. They proved it. They analyzed, you ready for this? 500,000 patients found zero increased risk of pancreatic cancer with GLP-1 GIP and glucagon agonists. In fact, the other side of the equation happened by reducing obesity, the primary risk factor for 13 different cancers. Redatride is profoundly and powerfully anti-carcinogenic. It eliminates it. How is this not getting to you guys? How do you guys not get this? Somebody asked me, okay, so if it's so good, why do I need to cycle it? So, let me go over this stuff real quick. If I had a kangaroo and I was going to start my kangaroo on this. You guys can keep thinking and talking about your I'm going to start at this massive dose 2.5 milligrams a week. I'm going to take 2.5 milligrams twice a week. Here's your side. I I have no sympathy for your side effects. You're just not willing to listen because you'd rather trust some guy with a trap vein on on social media. Knock yourself out. Okay, then it's just not going to work for you. And that's cool. And if you go work for me when I did it, awesome. More power to you, bro. It still doesn't matter. It's not. It's going to cause such horrific biological damage long term. And you're playing checkers when you should be playing like calculusbased check in chess. You shouldn't be doing it like this. And I'm just trying to give you the information so you make the decision in the right direction. But you do you. If I had this kangaroo and I needed to start, I would start at 0.25 0.5 milligrams at the most per week. I don't care how fat you are. I don't care if you're switching from something. I don't care. 0.25. 25 or 0.5 period. Start there. Tit right up. The sweet spot's four. And if you go to my comments go, I'm at 10 already and still doesn't have it doesn't handle my appetite. And first of all, it's not magic. And second of all, if you have a psychological problem where you just can't stop shoving cake into your bark hole, hypothetically, tessensine would be a better choice for you because it solves the psychological aspect of it significantly better than reach. But I'm sure your Insta bro told you that. Serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, handles all that stuff and it works very well and it's oral. Yeah, you probably stink because it's mixed with DMSO. If you get it mixed with anything else, you're buying bunk. Just so you know, if you get it in a pill, I don't care who sold it to you. It won't be me. Won't be my company. I'll just tell you that right now. I'm trying to help you. Or you argue some more. 0.25, go up to or start at 0.5 at the most and titrate up at 0.25 25 to 0.5 more every week. If any side effects show up, stop. Back off. Stay there. Wait another week or two. Then titrate up for half the amount that you just tried. If the side effects don't show up, you're golden. If you have appetite suppression, you don't need to go any further. You do get that, right? If you're getting the if you go, I want more. That's what you guys do. You're like, yeah, but I want to lose this all in three weeks. My buddy did that three weeks. Yeah. And he spent half his day puking into his coffee cup. He's just not I don't know what to give you guys. I'm trying to give you the information. And most of you guys argue because you want to be right, not because you are. So 0.25 or.5 start there. Titrate out. Sweet spots four four milligs. And if you're like, how do I mix it though? How do I do all that stuff? The number of times I and I'm going to I'm going to post a short version of this in Instagram. And I got to start linking my podcast to Instagram because I never do. I just talk. I just come out here and turn on the mic and just start blasting. But like I have put out the playbook with kindergarten level handholding. All you have to do is read the highlighted areas. People when it goes click when it says just you know on Instagram when it says comment whatever it is XYZ for research when you do that a little message pops up in your DMs and then it has a button that says cuz people couldn't figure it out. Click this button. Here's your sock. The button it spits out a second message. That's all you're getting. The second one was says, "Here you go. Hope it helps." Something like that cuz I do. Click that button. It sends you to a Google form. Yeah, I want your name, your username. Or actually, it's not even that. It's your username and your email and a yes, I agree that I'm just You're not agreeing. You're not giving me power of attorney over your life. And when you click that, it spits out a little link. You click that link, it opens up a Google doc. Do what you want with it. You just have to go through the highlighted areas and find it. It literally handholds you how to do it. And yet people go, "It's too hard. Can't you just give it to me, bro?" No. Talk to your political officials because they don't let me do that. It's against the law. There you go. So, you're welcome. That's all you have to do. So, there will be an exact playbyplay on what and how today. Today's January 1st, 2026. It'll be in there. You just have to actually go and follow the yellow brick road through the messages in your DMs. This isn't hard, people. It's not hard. how to work through it. You can This is also a lifetime peptide longevity if you use it correctly with it's week the weekly pharmacocinetics. It's not a cycle. It is a forever peptide for one simple reason. It restores homeostasis. It doesn't force an artificial state whatsoever. Recalibrates the system back to its natural healthy set point. It builds a very robust resilient biology capable of resisting the diseases of modernity. Watch. It solves the triad, right? The three biological failures. It incinerates visceral fat. Shuts down systemic inflammation. It restores insulin sensitivity. It powers the cellular power grid, your ATP. It's the It's like the ultimate takeover of your biology and you're coming in and you don't like the board of directors and you fire them all and take over. Now you've got sovereignty. It's like you're seizing, get this, like you're seizing controlling interest of your own biological corporation. You the research is everywhere. The choice is yours. You can keep subscribing to this managed decline or be this recurring energy or recurring revenue stream. Or you can just pick up the proxy and frigin vote, baby. Become the majority shareholder in your own damn life. Listen, you want How about this? I'm already 45 minutes in. I really want you guys to understand this. You want the exact molecular playbyplay of how this nihilates those three biological failures. All right, I'll help you. Let's go to school, baby. Let's go to school. Biological failure number one because I think maybe this will help you guys. And I'm hungry. I want to go eat. It's already 2:15. But I want you guys to understand this. It's a cytoine fire is the easiest way to explain this. The source of the fire is not a mystery. It's your visceral fat as I explained the atapost tissue. This isn't passive. It's a dysfunctional endocrine organ that's having a mutiny against you. Hypertrophic fat cells become hypoxic. They recruit pro-inflammatory M1 macrophagages. Now these macroofagages along with the stressed out atiposites themselves become factories for TNF alpha and IL6 is your cytoine storm. Okay, you with me? Here's how redatride works through this. The mechanism is very direct and wicked. 2022 translational medicine showed the receptor activation by reatride directly inhibits the NLRP3 inflammosome in macroofagages. Let me explain why this is cool. The NLRP3 inflammosome is the ignition switch for IL1 beta which is a master inflammatory cytoine. Now you seeing how this comes together. Redatride comes in, sees the spark and it just dumps a bunch of water all over and says not my house baby. But here's what else it does. It cuts off the fuel supply by activating the GIP receptor. Reddit tide promotes the differentiation of atyposittes away from pro-inflammatory phenotype. Right? 2020 paper in molecular metabolism showed again you can go semaglutide does that whoaite. No, you need all three. Remember I explained that at the beginning that's why you need to understand this stuff. Promotes the differentiation of adiposites away from pro-inflammatory phenotype. It showed that GIP signaling encourages atapost tissue expansion through something called hyperplasia, which means creating new healthy fat cells rather than hypertrophy, which is stretching the existing ones into these giant inflamed water balloons. So healthy non-hypoxic fat cells don't puke out cytoines. GLP-1, GIP synergy doesn't just suppress apathy, by the way. It actively remodels the inflammatory organ into a quiet one. The fire is starved and suppressed at the same time. Look at biological failure too. The insulin resistance. So the mutiny that happens in your body happens at the insulin receptor level. So in muscle and liver the topic lipid accumulation. So dasogglycerol, ceramides, all the stuff that the dags, right? And ceramides that I talked about activates protein kynise C activates protein kynise C theta won't baby which serene phosphorolates the insulin receptor IRS1. But here's the problem with that. Serere phosphorilation is the sabotage. It prevents IRS1 from activating the pathway that's crucial, the signal that tells the cell to open its glucose gates. the glute 4 transporters. The key is in the lock, but the lock is jammed up with a bunch of lipid and crap that somebody stuck in there. That somebody is you. Here's how redatride solves the problem. GLP1 GIP surge. These hormones cause a massive glucose dependent insulin release from the pancreas. This creates hyperinsulinemic environment that well can to some degree overwhelm the resistance through sheer force. It's the pharmacological equivalent of coming in and kicking the door down. Here's the best part. The glucagon. This is why they have to be done together. This is why you glucagon by itself is useless. This is, you know, just talking about genius. By forcing the liver to oxidize fatty acids at this insanely furious rate through the CAM PPK, a pathway 2021, by the way, New England Journal of Medicine, they detail this cover to cover. Red truth incinerates the very fat deposits that are causing the insulin receptor sabotage. It doesn't just clean out the gunk from the lock. It eliminates the factory producing the gunk in the first place. 2019 study in cell metabolism specifically showed that glucagon's lipid mobilizing effects in the liver are critical for reversing hpatic insulin resistance. You can't do it without it. So if you go semiglut or tzepide did it. No, they didn't cuz they can't. You're missing a critical piece. This coffee is good today by the way. How about the beta cells? Insulin resistance forces this is all coming into play here. Insulin resistance forces pancreatic beta cells to hypers secrete insulin until they tank. They burn out, burst into flame and die. Basically, red trutides rapid fat loss particularly from the pancreas itself, which is a phenomenon demonstrated by glucagon alone in human trials 2021. They showed this removes the lipotoxic stress. The beta cells recover the insulin insulin factory is it's not just salvaged. It's like a bad title, right? Salvage title. No, it's saved. It's just brand new. It's like a certified pre-owned baby. The last one is the ATP shortage because your energy grid is all based on ATP and it's collapsing. Mitochondria in an insulin resistant inflamed environment are completely crippled. We already know this. There's no magic behind that. They have reduced oxidative phosphorilation capacity. So the problem is they produce excessive reactive oxygen species, free radicals, ROS's that damages their own DNA and their own membranes. This is remember I talked about SS31 the inner mitochondrial membrane cardipin all of this stuff. So the cells I'm not telling you to run out and do that. I'm just saying this is a big deal. The cell's energy currency ATP drops into the floor without ATP cellular repair stops. Apoptosis starts programmed cell death of itself. Suicide reat is like an upgrade like a bolt-on upgrade for the power plants. The solution is metabolic flexibility. Red or true tide forces the body to become a very well-gineered hybrid engine effortlessly switching back and forth between fuel sources. This is what makes it badass. Watch the dramatic improvement in insulin sensitivity means skeletal muscle can once again efficiently take up glucose and fatty acids and burn them in the mitochondria for ATP. The glucagon driven hypatic fat oxidation directly increases energy expenditure ATP production in the liver. the body's metabolic command center for you. That's why your liver, by the way, you don't want to screw with. Don't trash your liver. Look at crucially by reducing inflammation. Redatride lowers the burden, the mitochondrial burden of dealing with oxidative stress. 2018 Redux Biology showed that these analoges reduce mitochondrial all three by the way analoges reduce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production the free radical production in endothelial cells which means less damage more efficient energy production you understand this triad isn't just interconnected it is an ugly vicious cycle because here's how it works I'll go full basic inflammation causes insulin resistance which causes ectopic fat storage which causes more inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Red or true doesn't just treat the symptoms at the same time like simultaneously it does this. It attacks all three parts of this cycle with such force that the cycle just disintegrates. It shatters it can't work. And here's the ugly part. This kind of pisses me off. The evidence that people like, oh it's just emerging. No, it's not. It's emerged. 2021 New England Journal of Medicine 22 cell metabolism papers decades of endocrinology. The research is all built on this. It is everywhere. This isn't a debate, you guys, on whether red or true tide or semiglutide or true zepide. This is a decision. Do you want something that works or do you just want to keep lying to yourself and going, "But my Insta bro told me." And my friend who's a soccer mom who also sells peptides out of her car is going to be the one that's giving me advice. I just really want to give her the business. Okay, maybe you guys go scissor in the back seat. I don't know what to tell you. I'm trying to help, but yeah, I'm a gritty doctor. So, it comes down to do you side with the business model of managed decline or do you side with the molecular truth that can set your biology up forever? Which one? Anyway, listen. I hope you got a bunch of information from this. If you were going to look at, by the way, I'll put this on at the end to see who actually pays attention for the full hour. The longevity dose, if I was going to do it for a kangaroo for lifetime, 0.1 milligrams per week. And if you go, how's not that not micro doing? Cuz I'm not doing it every day expecting to lose weight. I already explained the pharmarmacology. So, if you're about to get into my comments, what's micro doing? No, that's not what micro dosing is. 0.1 millig. I don't know. I hope this gives you something to kickstart your January 1st and help you in everything you're about to do. I'm going to go. Never miss.
