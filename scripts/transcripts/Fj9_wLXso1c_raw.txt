Test, test, test. Everybody wants to beat the clock and slow down time and have all the shortcuts in order to live longer in a life that they're doing nothing with. That's kind of what I see right now. But I you can want it all you want. You can look for all the shortcuts all you want, but until you do something about it, you're just another person making a bunch of noise talking about what you want, thinking somebody's going to do it for you. I think, you know, I get asked a lot about growth hormone and mimemetics and secrets. I think you you guys need to understand something. You guys have four people coming for you. Pain, weakness, stupidity, and decay. Those those are what's coming for you. Whether you like it or not, whether you go, I don't know if I really want to hear this, then don't. It doesn't change the truth. These are the four horsemen of your personal little apocalypse. You feel them. That ache in your knee. you know this every day. You just don't say anything about it because you you either try and stave it off or lie to yourself about it or go to some longevity clinic wellness doc who says they have the magic pill that's going to solve all your problems but the only person that can solve your problems is you and getting your system your biology back online. It's that like I said your the ache in your knee that tells you that you're falling apart. That mental fog where your cognitive ability is being reduced. the simple decisions that you make that feel like calculus-based physics and the exhaustion that makes getting up out of a chair like this or off your couch a monumental achievement. So, you go to doctors and they give you pills that treat symptoms that you have right now about as effectively as noiseancelling headsets treat a frigin fire alarm. That's medical malpractice in my opinion of the highest order. And most of you guys that are doing that, I'm hunting you. So, you should be afraid. And if you're not, then you're stupid already. See, understand the problem. If this is you and you've got this fog, this brain fog, these aches and pains, this exhaustion, this problem that you've all these, like I said, the four horsemen, pain, weakness, stupidity, and decay. The problem isn't your knee or your forgetfulness. The problem is a upcoming catastrophic systemic failure of command and control. The problem is a lazy aging dictator in your brain called the hypothalamus. And it's decided that running at your peak capacity is no longer a priority. It just can't be bothered. And its first victim is the master repair hormone, growth hormone. This declines at an alarming rate as you age. After 30, your pituitary gland isn't the problem. It's not. And that's where people get screwed up. It is perfectly capable. It's like this well-built, well functioning. All the machines are there. It's this dormant factory, fully staffed. Everybody's standing there with their hand on the button waiting for the order to start producing and the order never comes. Growth, hormone releasing, hormone secretion from the hypothalamus jumps off a cliff. It's the Grand Canyon and it's stepped off stepped off the edge a mile down. the factory floor goes dead and the result is a 14% decline per decade in the very listen to this in the very hormone responsible responsible in your system for cellular repair, metabolic function and structural integrity of your machine that you are piloting around as you ambulate through this world stuffing ding-dongs and ho hos and every possible vape pen you can into your bark hole. You're not aging. You're being dismantled piece by piece. And it's from the inside out. Some of you guys are doing it on your own voluntarily under the guise of you only live once. You're not going to live at all if you keep doing that because the solutions that you're sold are this testament to human gullibility. Growth hormone. Listen to what I just said. Oral growth hormone. It is 191 amino acid polyeptide. It has the same chance of surviving your stomach acid as a snowball in a [ __ ] blast furnace. Never going to happen. and it's digested into these worthless amino acids before it even hits your dadum. The entire industry is a scam, praying on desperation. And I see you guys doing it and falling for it all the time and getting in my comments and arguing about it to defend that it worked for you, bro. But it didn't. So, here's what the smart people think. Yeah, but injectable GH, how about that? Wrong. That's the thinking of a blunt force uneducated traumatist. You're flooding your system with exogenous growth hormone is like trying to fix a Rolex or this this Richard Mill with a this sledgehammer. You shut down your own production via something called negative feedback that a lot of you guys need to understand. You create insulin resistance and you swell your carpal tunnels in your wrists. You're adding a foreign substance that your body doesn't know how to rhythmically pulse. This is important. Pay attention. There's going to be a test. It's a fake static signal in a system that demands dynamic pulsatile communication and you are [ __ ] it up. The solution is not to add the hormone. The solution is to fix the signal. The solution is to fire that lazy dictator and put a competent leader in charge of your system. That leader is something called tamarellin. Tamarlin is not a growth hormone. And if you I tried growth hormone, it was better, bro. No, it wasn't. It was different. and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. And growth hormone works very well, excellent, but it comes married to a whole bunch of problems. Tamarellin is the signal for growth hormone. And here's why it's different. It's a synthetic optimized version of growth hormone releasing hormone that your hypothalamus should be producing. It is 45 amino acid peptide. It's a 44 amino acid peptide and it's engineered for stability and potency in your system. And what it does is it walks up to the smatotroof cells in your pituitary gland and it binds to the GHR receptor, the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor and it initiates a perfect physiological cascade adenolate cycles activation cyclic AM increase protein kynise activation leading to the transcription and pulsatile release of your body's own authentic there's that word you guys all love authentic growth hormone. This is the difference between you can use the Bible giving a man a fish and teaching him how to fish. I will make you a fisher of men. That's what Jesus says. But understand this is the difference. Here's the fish. Let me teach you how to do it on your own. Tamarella teaches your body to fish. It restores the natural and incredibly elegant rhythm of your youth. Now, let me explain what this actually fixes because it's not vague wellness. It is specific and agonizing failures that are defining modern life that people are using and treating as normal when they're not. Your decline is not normal. Managed decline is not healthcare. Aging is not meant to be crippling. They're not the same. And if you go, why do old people need canes then? If you go back, my grandparents in their 60s and 70s were still just as agile and spry as could be. Now I am 52 and most people would struggle to do what I do. My wife is 46. I don't know anybody that could keep up with her. And it's not to brag on my wife. It's because that's what she is badass. So let me explain what tamarellin is going to solve so you actually understand. It's one is going to be the visceral fat problem. And this isn't about having a big pooch or a belly. Visceral atapost tissue is a parasitic inflammatory organ that is screwing up your life. It secretes tumor necrosis factor alpha and interlucan 6 I TNF alpha IL6 creating a state of chronic systemic inflammation and if you've listened to me for any amount of time you know that systemic inflammation firmly believe and have proved it countless times is the precursor and the foundation of virtually all diseases that we have. This is the root of athoroscerosis, hypertension, insulin resistance, you name it. Tamarellinind induced GH pulsations activate hormone sensitive lipase which is specifically targeting and liberating these fat stores from within your abdominal cavity. So it actually does its job. It gets it out of where you don't want it. It literally diffuses the inflammatory bomb that you've got ticking in your gut, but you can go ahead and keep taking fat burners that you bought at GNC. How about the cognitive decline, the dementia, the Alzheimer's? Those things going on. Your brain is starving. The cognitive collapse is coming. It is failing to produce something called BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor, which is the fertilizer for your neurons. It's like brain food. Synaptic plasticity declines. Amalloid beta plaque accumulates because the glimpmphatic system in all its wonder, all its wonder and magic can't do its job because it's designed to clean the brain during deep sleep and it's failing. Tamarellin changes all of it. The pulsatile again there's that word pulsatile GH surge elevates IGF-1 which crosses the bloodb brain barrier and upregulates the BDNF the brain derived neurotrphic factor. This promotes neurogenesis not all over the place specifically in the hippocampus. It enhances cerebral blood flow and it improves the efficiency of the pressure washing system which is the glimpmphatic system during the deep sleep that tamarellin promotes. So if you have a hard time sleeping, tessamarellin will change that even more effectively than dip will. It doesn't just clear the brain fog, it rebuilds the [ __ ] hardware. The reason I get so irritated about this and so disappointed in the methods that and mechanisms that people choose is because they're making choices based on an influencer with abs or a commercial that they saw on television that says this is how it should be and then they take it. It doesn't work and they blame nothing but their genetics. It's you. It's you. You need to fix the machine. How about the structure of the system? Sarcopenia, you guys, and your semiglutide and your tzepatides. Both of those are muscle wasting 100%. You can get in my comments. You can argue all you want. You're still wrong. It doesn't change the truth. Whether you like me or not, it doesn't change the facts. Redatride is the only one that prevents muscle wasting. Period. You can talk to me about bioglutide. I'm not going to listen. Adding things to the mix doesn't make it better. Redatride is a peptide marvel. I called it what it is yesterday. It is a metabolic monster. This thing is so effective and it does so many wonderful things for longevity. And I got all of you guys out there complaining and crying about how micro doing is better. Even making podcasts about me. Keep sending people my way. That's totally fine. You can go against me all you want. Physiology and pharmacocinetics are still on my side. So it doesn't matter what you do. All you're doing is bringing more attention to the fact that there's a good chance that I am incredibly intelligent and you are not. I don't care how big your following is. That doesn't mean anything. I don't care if I have no following. Doesn't mean anything. Doesn't change the truth. If nobody's around, gravity still exists, [ __ ] My truth is the truth and it always exists. My gravity is all-encompassing because it's based on facts. It's based on physiology, human biology, not some guy that calls himself something and then has a giant YouTube following to try and make a video about me or a social media presence that tries to contest what I say. I don't care. It doesn't change the fact that I'm still right. You can call that arrogant. I call it fact. And I've got the receipts behind me. So, it's not arrogant. It is egotistical. And my ego is based on the receipts that I've got stacked behind me because I've proved it time and time again. Just because your chat GPT can get in and write you a fancy little speech or can test what I say doesn't mean you know what I'm talking about or you even know what you're talking about. It means that you can read and copy and have a vague comprehension of human biology enough to make yourself sound smart to dumb people. I have nothing for you other than facts and I will shove them down your throat every second of the day because I'm sick of Insta Bros, Insta Gurus, influencers, social media, whatever the hell you guys call yourselves. Wannabe doctors, actual doctors who are sellouts, longevity clinic, wellness clinic, I'm bragging, wearing my scrubs in my selfie [ __ ] picture on social media. Idiots that go around angry because what I'm doing is systematically dismantling their lies because I'm not asking you for anything. I don't care if you join my black card. I don't care if you buy something from me. I don't care if you go to Elite Biogenics and buy from me or not. I don't care. What I care is that you have the information to make an educated decision and you stop listening to these people thinking that they're experts just because a lot of people follow them. What that tells me is they're good at telling stories, not that they're intelligent. Because when you tell somebody what they'd like to hear, they magically just follow you around. Because people will believe everything as long as it's in agreement with what their dogma is and it's a compliment. If it's an insult and it disagrees with the indoctrination you've been peppered with, you guys lose your mind. You get unglued. Think about the structural meltdown of your body. Sarcopenia, osteopenia, the thinning of the skin, the degradation of your cartilage. These are not inevitabilities. They are failures of anabolic signaling. GH directly stimulates something called the mTor pathway for protein synthesis. Preferentially, by the way, recruiting type two muscle fibers to combat the frailty. The frailty that is headed your way like a freight train. It activates osteoblasts to lay down new bone material density. So, you actually have strong cortical bone, the outside, the thick, not the tbecular bone inside. It instructs fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, reversing the dermal thinning and the accel and and accelerating the wound healing from a cellular from a molecular level upwards. We're still on to samarellin. What am I at? Two things. three things. How about your circadian rhythm? That's a train wreck. The most profound GH pulse, just so you know, should occur during stage three and REM sleep. This is when the repair happens. The only time it happens, aging shatters this architecture. Injecting tamarellin at night syncs the entire repair protocol with your body's innate circadium biology. Because you guys think circadian rhythm is sleeping and waking. It's so much more than that. It doesn't just help you sleep. It weaponizes your sleep. So you wake up stronger and more powerful because that's when you are building. Now listen for all of you connoisseurs about to ask me the most ridiculous question which is what about surarellin? Forget it. Serellin is a 29 amino acid fragment. It is the obsolete eight track player stereotype to samarellin is the finished product. Superior stability, longer halflife and proven clinical superiority in elevating IGF levels. It's the difference between a Model T and a Tesla Plaid. Not even in the same, never mind the cortisol and the prolactin spike that Surmelon causes all the time. The protocol is simple because genius and the truth is simple. Hypothetically, by the way, because this isn't meant to treat, cure, diagnose, solve, triage, prescribe, advise. It is only hypothetical, entertaining, and educational. And it has nothing to do with reality. If you know, you know. Why? Because if I don't say that, some jackass is going to give me a hard time or complain about it. And then next thing you know, you guys don't get the truth. You go right back to being indoctrinated with a bunch of lies with people in lab coats or white coats with a god complex calling themselves doctor. Well, I can call myself doctor all day long. It's real. But I don't act like a prick and demand that you follow me. Don't follow me. Don't listen to me. Don't pay attention to anything I'm telling you. Go right back to doing the same things you were doing. Let me know how that works out for you. I'm a 52-year-old walking billboard of exactly what I do. And my outward life is an is a direct reflection of everything I do. So, if you don't like my outward life, then you're right. Don't listen to me. But I have an exceptional marriage of two decades. I'm fit and athletic as hell at 52, rich, strong, devoted, walk with God every day, incredible [clears throat] children. I love my life. I love helping people. I don't know. I think my life's pretty good. Hypothetically, one to two milligrams every night, half hour before bed. That's it. Normally, I don't even give this stuff because all you guys whining about dosages. You know why? Because I'm I'm not supposed to be able to give you I'm I can't even give you that. How dumb is that? But I can tell you how many aspirin to take, how many Tylenol to [ __ ] yourself up. That's being marketed to pregnant mothers saying that it doesn't cause any harm. Screw you. If you are ignorant enough to believe that and go, "Well, that's why they have tests, bro. That's why they recommend it. That's why my wife had this, my daughter had this, my mom had this, and that's why Tylenol saved her. No, it didn't. No, it didn't. Aside from the fact that it depletes your glutathione reserves the second you take it, you got to start all over again. Keep going there, Einstein. If you haven't figured it out yet, that's the mood I'm in today. I'm done with the [ __ ] and the lies and the people that go out preaching that they're experts trying to point at people like me who come out to help you, trying to discount, dismiss what we talk about because your ego is so fragile because I'm stealing your business. I'm not even asking for business. I'm going, "How about you just listen to the facts and have a better quality of life instead of listening to these jack wagons that want your money bragging on their fancy clinic as they go home in their Rolls-Royce? I don't care what you drive, but you better get it from helping people, not lying about what you're doing that's helping people, cuz it's not for your kangaroo. Half hour before bed, 3 months minimum, minimum 6 to 9 would be better. This isn't some lifestyle s suggestion, you guys. This is a a biochemical imperative that will change your life. But understand, it's not just to samurrel. And you really want to go down the rabbit hole, let's do this. Let's let's dance. You want to fix a broken system, then you need all the tools. So, I'll give you the ultimate repair stack that'll help. It'll give you a systemic overhaul. You decide. This is what I would do for me. I don't care what you do. I'm simply just putting it out there before somebody's like, "Well, he told me to do this." No, I didn't. In fact, if that's what you're going to say, I'm telling you not to do this. You should avoid me at all costs. You should listen to nothing I tell you to do and go back to listening to your fat doctor with a big gulp on his desk and 17 prescriptions and all the drugs you want. Baby, you should keep listening to the YouTube doctor who says you should listen to me over everybody else. I don't care if you listen to me. That's what's the best part about being me is I don't give a [ __ ] if you listen to me. I just give you the facts. I lay it out for you to play it out. So, here's I'll I'll lay it out. You decide what you do with it. Tamarillin, you can go right up to 2 milligrams a night. You don't have to. You start at one, but don't be cheap. Don't do it because you're cheap. If you're like, I'm trying to to extend my my vial. That's cheap. Yet, you run out and put new rims and rubber on your truck. No. My sympathy, my empathy is zero for people like that. Tamrillin 2 milligrams for the This is all for a kangaroo by the way. This destroys I I will help you. I'll give you a couple of variations of this. Even you want to lose fat, here's what I would do. M C three times a week, 5 milligrams. I would see is a real derived peptide that is the master the master regulator of homeostasis. works so synergistically with tesamarill and it makes insulin sensitivity the only priority your body has and it upregulates fatty acid oxidation in ways that you can't even comprehend. Add in SS31 5 to 10 milligrams every day hypothetically. You know, I'm not going to give you dosages. I'm just going to tell you this cuz otherwise you guys just you guys aren't going to pay attention. SS31 targets the electron transport chain within the mitochondria, specifically the inner mitochondrial membrane. It reduces oxidative stress, improves cellular energy production. This is this is like like that what is that fuel they use for monster trucks, right? Ethanol. Methanol. Methanol. I think it's methanol, right? I don't know. I just remember the brod dozer that did it all in a diesel which was pretty badass. But methanol, that's what this is. So you want to torch fat to Samarellan MC SS31. You're welcome. You want to fix your brain to samarellan. Same thing. Always start t always the same thing. always this the platform is always based on tessamarellin cerebral ghcu cerebrin is not a peptide by the way it's a neurotrophic factor concentrate it's the most powerful agent on the planet for promoting neurogenesis and synaptogenesis and repairing neuronal damage so if there's any ever anybody if they have a kangaroo that has dementia or Alzheimer's even multiple sclerosis all of this stuff this should be first on your hit parade it is a complete systematic update for your CNS, your central nervous system. In GHKCU, man, this is like armor. I've called it this before. It's like armor for your neurons. The cognitive protective and neurogenic effects are unbelievable. It works so well with the elevated IGF-1 from tamarellin. It would almost be foolish to not include it. That's if you want to fix your brain. How about you want to solve injury problems? You got a bunch of injuries that are nagging to samurrel BPC TB5. I don't even need to explain it. I talk about it all the time. How about this? Tasamarellin. Ipamarellin. Ipamearellin is a ghrelin mimetic that you can stack with tamarillin to give you this additional complimentary GH pulse. Gives you enhanced recovery. So if you're really pushing yourself hard training, this is what you want to do. And clomophene. This would be for dudes, not for not for women. This is for men. Restores the hypothalary gonatal access. The one that gets disrupted by poor anabolic steroid administration, testosterone administration by listening to bro science in some gym in over by the squat rack boosts endogenous testosterone production which is crucial for the full anabolic effect the vitality effect of putting this together. But a pamlin it's another powerful layout. None of this is a cost. I think you guys need to understand that none of this is a cost. This is an investment in the only asset that you actually own. I think you need to really stop and look in the mirror and go, "What do I really own?" You own you. Your physical vessel, this thing that you walk around in all day long. The alternative is a very slow, miserable, expensive, managed decline. And I mean managed by a medical system that profits from your sickness. The data isn't gone. It's not hidden. None of this is speculative. This is based on pure science, pure human biology and physiology. You have the tools. I've talked about it even with a pitilon. You have the tools to slow the clock and not even reverse its most devastating pathologies. The question is no longer what in the hell is wrong with me? The question you should be asking is do you have the will and the drive and the actual capacity to fix it? Are you willing to do it? Because I think a lot of you guys accept broken because it's tolerated. But it's tolerated until you are on death's doorstep and you're sitting in a room all by yourself while the world is still spinning by. And had you only done X, Y, and Z, you wouldn't be in that room. How about you just start engineering a better [ __ ] biology? But that's just my thoughts. What do I know? Hope you got something out of this. I got to go. Ever miss.
