All right, this one is totally off the cuff. I was inside and I was talking to Brandy and I was looking through some of my messages from you guys and I came across one where somebody's been struggling to lose weight and they've been through a lot of stuff and listen to a lot of so-called experts. So, I tell you what, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to explain exactly how to do it from cover to cover. I'm going to give you the entire playbook on how to do this, when to do what, what to do, how to eat, how to figure out your calories, what compounds to take. I'm going to just do it all. Just for the love of God friaking do it. All right, I'm going to need some coffee for this. It's weird because it looks like it has some weird foam on it. If you can see my I don't know why because you know me, it's jet black. Comes from my um Nespresso. This thing, it spins at like a billion RPM. Spits out a nice cup of coffee. Before you guys get in my comments and start telling me how bad that coffee is, shut up. Don't listen to Don't listen to my show. Then shut up. I don't care about your opinion. This is my house, my opinion. You don't like it, pound sand. Listen, here's the deal. This is why I'm so agitated about being obese. There is nothing sex. Let me get this straight. There is nothing sexy. Nothing. Not a damn faking thing that is sexy about being obese or fat. Nothing. There's nothing. Your biology hates you. Your bank account hates you and the reflection that you see in the mirror, it hates you the most. And you damn well know it, you guys. Just let that land. You You know it, you know. And here's the issue. The problem isn't entirely you. And and this is why this I am doing this entire podcast episode based on one thing that I got from Instagram from one dude that was like, I can't stand it. I've been through all these idiot trainers who all claim that they have the next best method. Yeah. You know what? All of you personal trainers, [ __ ] off. You guys are all a bunch of scammers listening to some I'm the fit I'm the fitness business guru. Yeah, you know exactly who I'm talking about. This idiot. This idiot that this [ __ ] Canadian [ __ ] that should not be coaching anybody cuz he's a liar. I would never trust this guy as far as I could throw him. That's why his wife left him. I'll just leave it at that. If you know, you know. If you don't, then it's too bad. Just tired of people that are full of crap, man. Just the problem isn't you. The problem is the damn circus that you're being sold. You're being fed this garbage narrative. Listen, if you are fat or obese or you just have 20 pounds to lose or 10, I don't care. Just listen to me. Listen to me from start to finish. I will give you the answers. I'll just help you from cover to cover cuz I am the only doc out here that gives a [ __ ] about you more than you do. That you're being fed this garbage narrative that hardcore god tier willpower diets pushed by some personal trainer. this idiot on Instagram who thinks that because they got abs or they've got knowledge and that their way is the best way because they have some proprietary blend and they productize everything. Let me tell you let me tell you something. Let me explain this. Okay, I you guys, if you know my story, great. If you don't, I'll tell you real quick. I went through cancer a whole bunch of times four years ago. They took a lung out of my chest. This one. And I was scrawny and weak. And you know what? You know who else has abs? I'll help you. Uh [ __ ] person with cancer. I know I had abs. I had abs. You know who else? A heroin addict. Heroin junk. You want their diet plan? You want my six-pack that I had after I was in ICU after they pulled this cannibal tumor out of my chest at first and then pulled my lung out as well? You want my how to get abs via near-death experience program? Come on. You ready to get that one? Of course not. You guys are putting your faith in a bunch of idiots that should not be on social media because all they do is make a bunch of noise. I am so tired of the bro science twatwaffles. these these gurus, these guys who instead of upgrading their real knowledge, they spend their pathetic lives trying to discount everybody else's. They will spend 7 hours, 7 8 9 hours, days, weeks combing PubMed for a single sentence that they can take out of context to discredit somebody who's actually helping someone all because they're exposed as the imbeciles that they are. Another NASM certified clown trying to get rich off of the desperation of good people who've just had a lifetime of failure from a string of non-expert experts. That's it. I'm done with you guys if it's you. Oh, I'm going to I'm going to burn your eyes out just like the medical world. You want a good trainer? You want a really this and listen a real trainer? I'm not going to tell I'm not training anybody. I'm not training any of you because all of you guys don't listen. But here you go. His name is Jud Leanhard. Look him up. Look him up. L E I N H A R D Jud. The guy is about I think he's 46. He's about about 260. Moves like a [ __ ] gymnast. He pays me nothing. I have no vested interest in his business, in him. He is just I'm just really good friends with him and I trust him and I like him and the guy is freaking smart. He knows how to really be a trainer and he will turn you into an athlete at 45, 50 years old, no matter what you look like right now. He is just the best I've ever seen. You're welcome. You're welcome. Now stop wasting your time looking up all the other idiots because they're cheap. I don't care how much he charges. He's worth it. How about that? If he says, "Yeah, it's going to be 10 grand a month." Pay him. If he says it's going to be $100 a month, pay him. I'm not kidding. That's how much faith I have in this guy. But listen, you're welcome. I'm going to stop right there. But let's be very, very clear. If you are fat and you are expecting the world to acclimate to you, you deserve to be eaten. Darwin isn't a theory. He's a [ __ ] bill collector. He's coming for you, man. You want Listen to me. This is so important. Like, I almost died, man. And and you guys, some of you guys are willingly going out and just stuffing every slab of pie and cake and packaged whatever the hell you're eating and dessert birthday cake in a cup, calling it a coffee nonsense that you can while you blame the world and go, "You should accept me for being a big fat fuck." Nobody should accept you. In fact, you shouldn't accept you because that's not healthy and you damn well know it. You know what you're defending? Let me explain what all this extra weight is. It's not a personality trait, by the way. It's a pathology. Listen to me. We're talking type 2 diabetes. Your cells are giving your insulin the middle finger until your pancreas throws in the talent says, "I'm out." That's it. Now you have to metformin. Hummalogue pump just gets worse. We're talking hypertension. Your heart is working overtime 24/7 to push sludge through pipes that are clogged with all kinds of hyperinflammatory residue. So now they're filled with velcro. You're a ticking time bomb for a stroke or heart attack. It has nothing to do with your cholesterol. It has to do with the insulin problem and the inflammation that you've got. So save your statin conversation because cholesterol doesn't cause heart attacks or strokes. The Framingham study proved that already. Talking about non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Your liver turning into this fuagra inside your own body. Debilitating osteoarthritis. Your skeleton is slowly grinding itself into dust under the load it was never designed to carry. Sleep apneoa. Literally forgetting to breathe at night, just waking up because you're trying to swallow your tongue. No, you're too fat. You're starving your brain of oxygen. This skyrocketed risk for at least 13 different types of cancer. Fat isn't inert. It is hormonally active. It is an organ and it's pumping out inflammatory cytoines that tell your body to grow tumors. This come on you guys. When I was a kid, nobody was fat. It has nothing to do with the food or the times. It has to do with what's tolerated. You guys are the Marcus Aurelius said it. You are ruthless with others and tolerant of yourselves. You need to flip that script. And what does modern medicine do? Nothing. Nothing. They don't solve the problem. They manage the decline as always because a patient on 12 different medications for the rest of their short miserable life is worth a hell of a lot more to the system than a healthy person. They'll give you a pill for blood pressure. They'll pay they'll give you a pill for blood sugar. They'll give you a CPAT machine for sleep and a knee replacement and a shoulder replacement. All while ignoring the one single glaring cause to all of it. It's a [ __ ] racket and you damn well will know it. And most of these personal trainers, most if you're listening to this, most of you guys aren't any better. They're not in it to help you. They're in it for the fame, for the insta clout. They want to be your next guru. And every single one of them listening to me right now is fuming because I'm right. Good. I hope I piss you off. I hope I make you so mad because if you go out scouring trying to do anything other than become a better version of yourself, you just proved my point. Buckle up, baby boys and girls. It's about to get bumpy. You don't want weight loss, by the way. If you are overweight, if you are obese, you want fat loss. Let me explain this cuz yeah, you can tell I'm lit. The scale is the world's biggest liar. Losing 5 to 10 lbs in a week is never fat. It is water, glycogen. It is precious, valuable, priceless, metabolically active muscle and connective tissue. So, when you step on the scale, you feel good for 5 seconds, but you function like a bag of dicks because you're demolishing the very machine you're trying to upgrade. Most people aren't wired like my wife and me. That's okay. We go hard. We leave nothing in the tank. And before some smartass in the back wants to chirp about overtraining, I have one lung. My 46-year-old wife has built two entire human beings inside her. Save your The key isn't some perfect macro ratio from a fitness influencer. The key is in your DNA. It is the thousands of years of genetic code, the programming that gives exactly zero [ __ ] about your beachbod. Its only job, its one and only job you guys is to prevent you, and I said this the other day for them the day, this is in every single strand of your DNA. Since you started dividing and multiplying cells, their only job is to prevent you from starving to death. Because here's what happens when you diet. This is why your little salad isn't going to work. You'll get skinny fat. Hey, everybody raise their hand. Say it with me. I'm skinny fat. Yes, you are. You know what's wild? I am about 200 lb. I'm just under 5'11 on a good day. I'm 10 and a half. Maybe it's probably more accurate depending. I'm getting older, so I'm probably shrinking. I move like an athlete. I function like an athlete. And I've seen people that are 200 lb that are shaped like a beach ball. The number isn't what matters. The tissue isn't what matters. The composition is what matters. Please understand that. You guys are looking at the wrong things. But here's this is why dieting is such a racket. When you diet, here's what your DNA does. Your metabolism tanks. Your thyroid says like red alert, famine. Your thyroid. It freaks out and slows everything down to a crawl. So you get cold, weak, tired. Your hunger hormones like ghrelin go through the roof. It's not a lack of willpower. It is a biological siren screaming that you eat. Your reward circuitry in your nucleus encumbent gets incredibly hyper sensitive to food. So at carrot starts looking like a chocolate cake because your brain is so desperate for energy. You guys know what I'm talking about. Your cortisol spikes because you're stressed and anxious and your body starts clinging to belly fat and visceral fat for dear life. and your leptin, the I'm full hormone, plummets because your brain thinks your fat stores are empty even when you've got 100 lbs to lose. Let that sink in for a second. You are fighting your own operating system, you guys. And you've been sold this dogmatic lie that big is beautiful. Let me tell you the truth. Big is suicide. It's selfishness. Honestly, big is absolute disgusting ignorance. And in 99.9% of cases, being fat is a damn decision. It is a choice. It is a choice that that's now not just tolerated. It's celebrated. And they've made it just the easy choice. And in fact, they've made the easy choice even easier because you get a reward for being a fat bastard. You're not healthy. Listen, I don't care if you go, "It's my body. I can do what I want." What happens if you have to pay for every single problem that you cause for yourself and everybody that you love and care about because of your ignorance that you can't say no because you have the impulse control of a three-year-old? How about then? Your decision? Absolutely. I bet you make some new ones, though, huh? So, listen. How do you beat it? I And I I said this it it's probably on the cover somewhere cuz I'm debating on what I'm going to put on my thumbnail. But how to lose 50 lbs of pure fat in less than 90 days. I could probably say less than 60 days to be honest without turning your metabolism into a smoldering crater and chewing up your muscle like steak at a wood chipper. So, here's how it just You might want to grab a pen, grab a pencil, stop driving. Don't do this when you're driving. Yes, cuz I give a [ __ ] I don't need you getting into an accident. Stop listening to the idiots and start listening to the guy that knows what he's talking about right here. So, here we go. Step one, calculate your calories. And these guys in their proprietary magic ways of crazy math, calorie math. I saw this bozo fit over 40 dad, whatever he is. This guy is such a muppet. Holy [ __ ] I've never met a dumber human being in my life. I watch the way he explains things. It makes me hurt. It makes me hurt because I looked at two pages of mathematical equations in a in a journal. And I thought, dude, I can do that in first grade mathematics in two lines. I'm about to prove it. Take your body weight in pounds. Poundb multiply it by 12. Yes, it has to be 12. That's your total daily calories, the result you get. No arguing. For example, I weigh 200 lb. So, if I wanted to lose weight, 200 * 12 equals 2400 calories. That's my aotment for the day. That's step one. Step two, protein is the ruler of all. Before somebody says, "Well, I read that gladiators were eating nothing but uh barley and stuff, barley, oatmeal, and all kinds of weird things." And they had crazy bone density. They also fought for a living. You don't. You fight the remote and your refrigerator door at 2 in the morning. You're not fighting for a living. Doing curls is not fighting for a living. Protein is the beall end all. So, take the same body weight. We'll use 200. Take the same body weight and multiply it by one. Or be smart and multiply it by 1.5. So 200 my body weight * 1.5 equ= 300 g of protein. That's my protein requirement for my day if that's what I was doing. I eat a little more but that's a whole different conversation. Now protein is 4 calories per gram. So 300 g * 4 calories equals ready for some math 1,200 calories from protein. That leaves me with 1,200 calories to do whatever the hell I want with. Now here's the best part. You can spend those 1,200 calories on whatever you want. Steak, great. Sleeve of Oreos, fine. Knock yourself out. Just understand the consequences. If you eat like [ __ ] you're going to feel like [ __ ] But the math doesn't lie. Listen, I realize I went over why it's not just calories in, calories out. You're right. Which is why there's more to this. Buckle up. I'm not done. Before some keyboard warrior with a CSCS certification tries to come at me, save it. I'm smarter than you. I have more degrees. I've worked with well over a million patients. I have better results. And I'm tired of you [ __ ] clowns. So step three, the non-negotiable walk is what I call it. Every single day, 7 days a week, you're going to walk one mile at a 16 to 17 minute pace. You don't miss. I don't care if you go to the gym. I don't care if you piss your pants when you're going for a walk. You walk one mile at a 16 to 17 minute pace every single day. I don't care if you're tired, you're hurting, you have a headache, your kids are screaming, your dog just ate your furniture. It doesn't matter. Every day, 365 days. Will lifting help? Should you go to the gym? Yeah, absolutely it'll help. But right now, you just need to move. Consistency beats intensity every damn time. There's more. Step four, the eating window. I'm going to give you 186 intermittent fasting. 18 hours empty, 6 hours to eat. For example, for me, I eat from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. I am 200 lb. And if you've seen me train, I am very good at what I do. And I started this all in a wheelchair 4 years ago, missing a lung. So don't, you have no excuses. And you can drink coffee, by the way, whenever you want, as long as it is one color, blacker than a witch's crotch. That's it. Step five. I'll give you a glucose hack, too, to help you out. You ready? The second you're done your biggest meal in those 6 hours that you're eating, the second you are done that meal, the minute you do it, you do this. Put the fork down, start moving, go for a walk, go for a 10-minute walk. Here's the physiology behind that. You just flooded your system with glucose. Insulin is spiking, rushing to shuttle that sugar into your fat cells for storage. But when you walk, your muscles are hungry, baby. So they pull that glucose out of your bloodstream for themselves for fuel. You blunt the insulin spike. You prevent fat storage. It is a total game changer. It's incredibly effective. I'll bet none of your little NASM trainers told you that because they don't really understand physiology. They know how to do a [ __ ] squat clean. Then we add in the pharmacocinetics, the codes that you need, the signals that you need, and this changes the game completely. three compounds, redatride, matzi, and slooh poo p 3332 because last time somebody went, you said it really fast, I didn't understand it. Speak fast. You know what you should do? Listen quicker, grandma. I don't know what to tell you. I'm 52. This is how I run. I don't have any other speed. I drink a lot of cups of coffee every day. And that's not why I'm like this. I'm like this because I'm just like this. Ask my mother. I've been like this since I was four. I've never operated slow. So let's let me break down how these work and what they do on a biological level so you actually understand what's happening in your body before you start sticking yourself with a needle. Yes. All three of them require a 29 gauge insulin needle. Nothing complicated. Redatide mods slp3 332. So reatrudide is a triple agonist. Hits GLP1 gip and glucagon receptors. So I'll give you some simple terms so we don't have to get fancy because I go fancy too much sometimes. Some of you guys who tell me I don't understand what you're saying. This is me man. This is all I got. I'm really good at being me. It tells your pancreas to release insulin more effectively. Tells your brain you're full. And it slows down gastric emptying so you feel satiated. And it tells your liver to burn more fat and sugar. It's this wonderful synergy of metabolic correction which is what you need. By the way, I have to tell you this part. I almost screwed up because I just about gave you a dosing. Listen, none of this is meant to treat, diagnose, triage, prescribe, advise, help, nothing. It is all for entertainment, all for education. All it's all hypothetical. In fact, this is all made up. It's all theater and it's all theory and none of this is it's just a big story. This is like Little Red Riding Hood and Three Bears. That's what this is. If you know, you know. Now, if I was going to run this for my experiment, it would be the Red True Tide. It would be once per week. No micro doing you guys. That is teasing receptors. It is begging for receptor desensitization. And if you go, I've been doing it for a really long time. It works really well, bro. Yeah. Until your receptors desensitize and then you're [ __ ] It's just a matter of time. Tick- tock. Tick tock, man. And that's it. No micro doing. Start at 0.25 mg per week. Titrate up, which means add a little more week by week by 0.25 to.5 milligrams based on your tolerance. So next week, if you're at 0.25 this week, today is Monday, it is whatever 320. Next Monday at 320, go to 0.5. And if you're still hungry and you still don't notice, next week go to 75 or just go to 1 milligram. That's up to you. Do not start with some astronomically large dosage because you're going to spend the rest of your day, probably the next 3 4 days, puking into your coffee cup. So pay attention. I'm trying to help you. More is not better because you can't untake something. I'd rather add to it than try and take something out of my body that's already been injected. You understand? Hey, so that's redide m C. This is a mitochondrial derived peptide. It's like it's a signal to your it's or it's a signal that your mitochondria send out to upgrade your entire met metabolism. It improves insulin sensitivity, enhances physical endurance massively, by the way, and promotes fatty acid oxidation so you burn more fat. Tells your body to become a very efficient fat burning machine and gives you the energy to do it hypothetically for the same experiment. 2.5 milligrams every other day. Don't ask me about micro doing. Don't ask me about anything else. This is when the the teacher comes out, me, and says, "This is what you need to know for the test." And if you start getting into the question box and you're like, "Well, I wrote an answer because I thought maybe you would take this, too." I won't, and neither will your biology. Slooh PP 332. Man, this stuff's like the holy grail of your whole life right now. I'm telling you, this is so good. It tricks your body into thinking that you're doing epic cardio, even when you're sitting your big butt on the couch. It marries up so well with reatride that this should almost be illegal. It ramps up mitochondrial biogenesis so you make more little reactors to burn more fat to create more energy. So you have the capacity to burn more fat. And it forces your body, you ready for this part, to burn fat for fuel 24/7 365. So not only does it say here are the engines that only burn fat, I'm going to make sure that's all they know how to burn. How badass is that? Redat tide mats slooh p332. This is what happens when you talk to somebody who actually understands human biology and physiology and cares about you, not about bank accounts and making a sale and affiliate codes and shaker cups and whether or not you see my abs. I'm going, are you going to be healthy and are you going to be around for your family and your kids, your wife, your husband? Are you going to be able to do the things when you're 45 that you wish you could do? Are you going to be able to get up out of bed? Are you able going to are you going to be able to get your dick hard when your wife goes, "I want it tonight. You better give it to me." Are you going to be able to go for a run, go for a bike ride? Are you going to be able to get in and out of that sports car you wish you've had or climb in and out of that truck that you want to buy or all the things that you want to do? Are you going to be around to walk your kid down the aisle, your daughter? Are you going to be in a wheelchair? You going to have an early death? And if you go, "Well, it doesn't matter what I do. God decides." You're right. God decides. Why are you speeding it up then? 200 micrograms every other day. Slooh PP 332. Now, this is for your kangaroo experiment, by the way. Now, stop here. Pause here. Pay attention here. Whatever it is, this is where most people screw this up so bad is the the Slooh PP 332 protocol. Most of you guys are literally just turned it off and said, "I'm going to go order this." And yeah, do I think you should go to Elite? Absolutely. But you you go wherever you want. But I'm going to tell you this. If we had this one guy that gave us this negative review and he [ __ ] stole the package, that's what's even better. I love when people give me a bad review. I'll even I I won't use his name cuz I'm not a douchebag, but he gave this review, said he never got the package. He ordered it on the 6th. He got it. It was delivered on the 10th. It shows it was delivered. We have a picture of the delivery that the post took and he said, "I never got it." And then he said he talked to the bank on a Sunday. Sunday. Interesting. I thought banks were closed on Sundays. And all of the problems of this. And then of course when you look this guy up, he's got this plethora of Yelp reviews that he's given to people. Nothing but shit-talking all these people. The guy's a professional scammer. But he's a manager at Home Depot, though. Good job, bro. I bet your family loves you for that. grown man, huh? Okay, I don't know what to tell you. This is the problem is the conduct of people. People act like toddlers. You know who should go out and give reviews? People giving good reviews. If you're going to complain, you know the number of times I've gone out and given a negative review or complained about anything is precisely zero. I've never gone anywhere and done it. And if you go, aren't you complaining now? No. I'm talking about some muppet toddler that is just like a lot of other people going, I want people to listen to me. And then they turns out they're the [ __ ] Here's the issue. There is a platform available to claim expertise with very few genuine experts. There is a platform to complain with very few people willing to take the brunt of the complaints and go stand here and take it anyway. Like me, I don't give a [ __ ] what you say about me. I don't give a crap what you do. I don't give a crap what you expose. I got nothing to hide. What I do know is I give a [ __ ] about mankind. And I come out here going, I'm going to give you all I got. So, you can either go, I don't really like this guy's delivery, or you can go, oh, it's about time a doc actually went, I care now. You guys need to grow up and start [ __ ] caring yourselves. That's what it is. But when I see people complain, I just laugh because I think, dude, you're a you're the one that's miserable. So, understand that if you're complaining about being fat, you did it. If you're complaining about something you did and you're mad about being exposed, like this muppet in the review where it was like, "Dude, it was delivered and it it proves that it's delivered." What do you got? The problem isn't in the complaint, it's with the complainer. So if you don't like your circumstances, you need to do something to change them because complaining has never changed a [ __ ] thing in anybody's life ever. Action has. So you can stay fat, you can stay miserable, you can stay broke, you can stay hating your marriage, you can stay being upset at this at the life that you have, or you can do everything in your power to change the entire damn thing. And I'm here to help you do it. I haven't asked you for a dime. I've come out here 282 days in a row. I haven't missed a single day and I've delivered and I brought the thunder every time. Why? Because I care. That's why. So listen to me when I tell you about the sloopy. You can do it transermally. You're going to use 10 milligrams transermally. It's significant cuz you have to account for all kinds of things. But the physiology and the fact that it just takes more of your money transermally, which gets very expensive. But the issue is when these muppets go out and they're like, you just mix it with bacteria static water. No, you don't cuz it precipitates out and it's useless. And if you mix it straight with DMSO, it feels like you got just you just got stung by a bullet ant. Don't do that either. So the guy with the biochemistry degree, the guy with the insane chemistry knowledge right here actually figured out how to do it the right way. So listen to me. I will explain it line by line. And I'm not going to do this again. Do not deviate from what I'm about to tell you. By the way, you have a 5 mgram vial of Slooh PP332. You add half a milliliter of DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. You slowly trickle it down the vial and then you roll it between your hands or you swirl it gently. Now you have a concentrated stock solution. Do not stop listening yet cuz if you do, you're going to experience a whole lot of pain. It's 5 mg per half millilit, which equals 10 mg per milliliter. Burn that into your skull cuz this is important. This is math and it matters with chemistry. Now get a new sterile empty vial. If you have to use one you used, make sure you rinse that out. It's nice and clean. Inject 2 milliliters. A milliliter is a volume. A milligram is a weight. Milliliters of bacteria static water into this new vial. So now you have one vial with your half a milliliter of Slooh DMSO stock. And you have another one with two milliliters of bacteriaatic water. You with me? Flip the vial upside down with the Slooh in it. Draw out all of the Slooh PP DMSO mix. Half a milliliter. 0.5 ml. Now, slowly take that other vial with the 2 milll of bacteriaatic water you just put in. And I mean slowly, I mean painfully, brutally, like you are, it's like watching paint dry. Slowly turn it on its side and drop by [ __ ] drop. Add the DMSO solution to the bacteriaatic water. Two drops. Three drops. Swirl. two drops, three drops, swirl. What you're doing is you're preventing shock and you're pre preventing it from precipitating out when it becomes instantly useless if you do that. Once you're done and it's totally fine, you now have 2.5 millit of a final solution that you are going to use. Don't shake it around like a rookie. So, your total peptide is 5 mg, 5,000 micrograms if you want to use that. Your final concentration is 5,000 micrograms per 2.5 ml, which equals 2,000 microgram per milliliter. And there's your math. So let me just give you because the 200 microgram dose is what you guys are like okay well what do I do cuz I think I just lost half of you in the mathematics. The final dose that you take from that new 2.5 milll final solution bile is 200 microgram that is 0.1 millilit. It is 10 units on a 100 unit insulin syringe. It is to the 10. That is 0.1 millit. So flip it upside down. Pull it out. There you go. Pinch a layer of fat in your belly and shove it in. That's about 20% is about what you can take. Otherwise, it starts to get uncomfortable. And that's it. Store it in the fridge. Keep it in the dark. This is the damn playbook. Now, this is how you lose 50 lbs of pure fat in 60 to 90 days. This is how you upgrade your entire biological operating system to run at a very new, lean, healthy baseline forever. Forever. And listen, before you guys start going into the comments, are there edge cases? Yeah, little biological outliers. Of course, but they're the 1%. the internet would have you believe that they're the 99% because the sickness gets the clicks. You know what gets results? Health doing the work. I don't care about your arguments. I don't care about your bro science. I care about you finally winning you guys. I care about you looking in the mirror and not seeing a victim of your biology and blaming everything around you. I just want you to master the whole [ __ ] thing. But listen to me. You don't just I think I need to say this. You don't just follow protocol. You have to understand it. Because when you understand the why behind it, it makes all of this easier. The how is effortless. Then this isn't bro science. This is a real doc, a real guy that understands science, giving you real information so you can actually go get real results. This is like battlefield level intel on your own damn body. So So let let's burn through this real quick. Red of True Tide. Okay, this is Think of your your metabolism like this incredibly disorganized orchestra that's been playing a bunch of wrong notes and like a funeral march with everybody's off key. That's how your metabolism has been for the last 1, two, three decades while you were turning yourself into a balloon. Red or true tide is the conductor that walks in, whacks the the stand, in fact probably kicks over the stand and gets every section playing in perfect fat burning, fattorrching, metabolic nuclear reactor burning harmony. So triple agonist, I said this before, it binds to and activates three very specific receptors, GLP1. Let me explain what they are because I think you need to know this. And if you don't, you can just fast forward and say, "I've heard this already." Maybe you don't know it. Maybe you should. This is the I'm full. GLP-1 is the I'm full, stop eating signal. So when retatride hits this, it tells your brain's hypothalamus that you're satiated. You've had enough. It also slows down gastric emptying. So your food sits in your stomach longer. It doesn't cause any paralysis or anything weird like that. Stop using semiglutepathide, by the way, cuz they're trash. The physical distension, right, of your stomach, the stretching sends a signal up the vagus nerve, which screams, "Hey man, we're full. Stop shoving cake into your bar hole." This murders hunger, turns it off in ways you can't. It makes you hate food. But it also tells your pancreas, hey, release insulin, but do it efficiently. So, it enhances glucose dependent insulin secretion, which means it only tells your pancreas to work when blood sugar is high, preventing nasty, brutal hypoglycemic crashes. Do you see now how it matters that you understand physiology? And we're just we're just getting started. GIP. So, this is the glucagon like peptide. It's like GIP. It's like glucagon peptide 1's long lost brother who decided to show up because what it does is GIP potentiates the insulin response from the pancreas that you got from the first receptor agonist even further. It makes your cells much more sensitive to insulin. So they're happy. They're holding out their hands going, "Please give me glucose instead of resisting it." But here's the killer. GIP also has an incredible effect on fat cells, adoptytes. It promotes lipid storage in subcutaneous fat under the skin over the visceral fat. the inflammatory crap around your organs. So, it's not just about less fat, it's about safer fat distribution. So, what it does is it promotes if it's going to store because there might be times where you're going to store. It's going to promote the storage to be subcutaneous instead of visceral because the visceral stuff is what's inflammatory and kills you, right? So, it promotes a safer fat distribution even if there is any storage. Now, do you see why this stuff matters? Glucagon is the last one. This stuff's awesome because this is like the absolute play of the game. So while insulin is storing energy, glucagon is the hormone that's telling you to release it. Remember, reatrite does two things that should be physiologically impossible. It just does it. Redatride activates this in the liver and it tells your liver, you stop hoarding glucose and fat, man. You're being greedy. Start breaking it down. Start pumping out all that energy. This increases energy expenditure and promotes hypatic lipid oxidation. So your liver burns its own fat stores for fuel. It's using the fuel that you're busy trying to store. So you're not storing anything. The net effect of this entire thing, just so we're very clear, I hope you didn't just hear my dog bark, by the way, is you eat less because you're full. The food you eat is processed nutrient partitioning. It's processed much more efficiently. Your in insulin sensitivity skyrockets and your liver and body become this fat burning furnace. It is a full system upgrade. And that's just one thing. Never mind the MC and the Slooh PP 332. And yet what they're going to have you do is some bro idiot with an NASM is going to go, "You should buy my fat burning stack because it's exclusive. I put it together with this nutrition company." garbage. White label garbage. Tell them to friend like give them just a happy little go at GFY M C. Listen to me. The mitochondria are the nuclear reactors, the power plants inside every single cell. When they're inefficient, you feel like crap. Your energy tanks, but then you tank as well. So, you store fat. You have no energy. Mi isn't fuel. It's a signal, right? It's a the peptide encoded in the mitochondrial DNA itself. Think of it as a a messenger from the power plant's chief engineer. and at the headquarters and it sends it to the nucleus of the cell where all the machinery is. So here's what the message says. Upgrade the facilities, get better, work better. It enhances mitochondrial biogenesis which means it builds more power plant. So it looks down on the floor and says you need to make more machines to make more energy. Improve fuel efficiency. So it enhances fatty acid oxidation because it's going to it's or what it's doing is it's teaching the body to burn fat for energy instead of sugar. It switches the substrate of choice. And then it says, "Fix the insulin response or fix the insulin resistance problem." So, it does this by activating the EMPK pathway. AMPK is the cell's master energy sensor. And I've talked about this before. When it's activated, it's the cells, hey, we're low on energy. Stop storing fat. Start burning because we're freaking out. We're going to die. This is the most incredible thing because it improves glucose uptake into your muscles effectively reversing the cellular resistance that is the hallmark of type two diabetes. Monty, this is how badass this stuff is. And yet they want to want you to take fat burners and they want you to take humalog and metformin. Why? Because that'll make you sick. This will make you healthy. MSI essentially tricks your body into thinking it's incredibly physically fit at a cellular level and it primes your metabolism for peak performance. It's like getting the the metabolic machinery of an athlete without having to put in two decades worth of work. We still got one more. Slooh PP 332. This is the most cool. This one this one fascinates me because it's it influences this transcription factor. It's a master switch that gets flipped on when you do endurance exercises, right? Long endurance, hard endurance exercises. So when you're out there running or swimming or cycling or or jogging or on a rower or at a dine or whatever it is, your body flips this switch on to ramp up energy production to meet the new demand, the temporary new demand. So what does flipping on this switch do? It tells your cells to create biogenesis. More bio mitochondria. Remember we just started doing this again with MC C. That's why this stuff's really cool. So you've got SL PP332 that gets flipped on. More mitochondria biogenesis. M C more mitochondria biogenesis. It programs these mitochondria to burn more fat. Weird. kind of like mod C and it does it to CH and it makes them choose this as their primary fuel source. Fatty acid oxidation strange like retatrite and mod C. This is why synergy matters. These guys throwing [ __ ] together that don't have any business doing it really pissed me off and it increases glue uh glucose uptake into skeletal muscle. So you're you're using stuff the right way. It's partitioning everything to go to the right place and you can't be an idiot and screw it up because the signals are coming from what you just injected into your system. Slooh PP 332 imitates the effects of endurance exercise at a genetic level. You are quite literally injecting a signal into your body that says, "We're in the middle of a marathon right now. Divert all energy to the muscles and burn all the fat you can find." Why would you not do that? And yet somebody's going to come and go, "Well, yeah, but come on. Is that really safe? We don't have any long-term studies." You know what long-term studies on Advil do? Tell you that it [ __ ] kills you. How about alcohol? That, too. Or statins. Yep, that too. Anti-hypertensives. Shall I keep going? No long-term study. Find me one study. One. One study. One. I'll wait. Where a peptide has killed anybody. I'll wait. Go ahead. I'll wait. And if you bring up any cancer studies, you can't. You can't. They do not exist. The MK677 study, I debunked that a long time ago and I proved it with the science and the study itself. I ripped it apart. Just like steroids and cardiovascular problems. Also debunked that with real science and and the guy's study. I tore that apart too. you are pharmacologically convincing your body that it is actively using 20 or it's it's actively exercising 24/7 365. This is why the dose timing is critical. You're creating this constant lowgrade fat burning exercise signal that works synergistic with the actual exercise that you're doing that one mile walk. So listen to me because I'm 41 minutes in on this and I have a bunch of [ __ ] to do yet today. These three don't just work alone. and they work in a vicious beautiful concert. Redatride controls the appetite and optimizes nutrient partitioning. MC C upgrades the machinery, the cellular machinery to be much more efficient at burning fat. Slooh PP332 gives you this constant exercise signal demanding that upgraded machinery be used to burn fat. Now, excuse me. You're influencing the deepest levels of your metabolism to do what they're designed to do. Nothing you're telling your metabolism to do when you do this is new. You're just telling it to do what it's forgotten how to do because you've taken the epigenetics has programmed your genetics to now operate like a sloth. You're not fighting your biology when you do this. You're you're commandeering it. You're turning the enemy's own weapons against them. Like you're not clashing symbols. There's no dissonance in your system anymore. Like this is how you win. You guys I don't know if there's ever been a more inclusive example of how to do this as as this 42minute video. I want you to win. You just have to make the decision to do it. It's your move, man. I got to go. Never miss.
