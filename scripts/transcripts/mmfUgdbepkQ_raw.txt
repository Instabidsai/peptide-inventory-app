Listen, so you guys know yesterday I had this. Like look at this. Look at my wrist. If you can see this like look at I'm all over the place. It's probably 60% reduced pain. It's probably easily I mean I It's still radically uncomfortable, but nothing like it was yesterday. I don't know if you can see it, but it's not even nearly as inflamed. I got pin cushion marks all over me, though. And what's wild is so he here's what I talked to a buddy of mine about my wrist and uh we were just talking and it just came up in conversation. He says, "Oh, dude, just grab some predinazone. That's the world we live in, man. Even you guys getting all but hurt and crying about Tren yesterday. You know, I'm just simply answering questions, right? You want selective answers as long as they don't, I don't know, make you look stupid. But the only way you'll look stupid is if you do stupid things. You're not stupid. You just conduct yourself stupidly. And so quit getting mad when I answer a question that somebody asks me. I had somebody go, "Oh yeah, clearly the guy's on trend." Dude, if I was on trend, you have any idea how I would look? I'm like 5'11 on a good day, 510 and a half better on a better day, and I'm 200 lb. And I am not giant by any means. So if I was on trend, you know who I I would look like? Oh Jesus, I would be so big. Holy crap. And not because of the aspects of longevity that I that I because if I'm going to go down that road to put on size, I'm going full send. So just so to be very clear for all you bozas, it's it's all of you guys looking for a reason why I am or anybody is more successful, more fit in a better place than you are, and you just can't comprehend that it's the one thing you guys are unwilling to do, which is the [ __ ] work. Which is again why I come out here and I just give you the answers. You do what you want with it. You want to get in the comments and cry like a bunch of little girls, you go ahead. If you want to sit here and actually learn something and go, maybe this guy has something valuable to offer me so I can actually get a better hold on life, do that. We're in a world built on whiners, complainers, and entitled people that think they deserve to win even though they don't do what's required to win. Because most of the people are envious of the results, but they're not envious of the work required to get those results. Same thing goes for knowledge. I know damn well what I'm talking about. I don't need to prove it to anybody. I come out here every day and my actions and my knowledge prove it in and of its own. Somebody challenges me on a on a concept, I'll bury you because I know what I'm talking about. But it's not because of anything other than your arrogance to think you can come into my comments and give me your bro science that you learned on Reddit or the fact that you asked chat GPT just to make sure that or just to make yourself feel better of being of being a [ __ ] idiot. Grow up. That's where I'm at with this because the only reason I come out here anymore every day and I've never missed is for the people that are desperate for this knowledge who I I just I want to give it all to you, man. I want to give you everything I've got cuz I care that much about mankind. I'm starting to not care so much about the people though that come in to try and run their mouth because you deserve the dumpster fire [ __ ] pile that you're living in. And all the words you can say to justify why you're there or why I'm winning and you're not or why somebody else is winning and you're not, that's fine. It still doesn't change your circumstances now, does it, Unan? So, listen. I was talking about my my wrist and I realized there's a peptide. So, I'm going to just start going through peptides and giving you guys everything I got on each one. And if that's not what you want to listen to, I don't know, change the channel. But predinazone is not the answer. Predinazone is for crying out loud. It is a demon. And I'll explain why before you guys go, prednazone's great. No, it's not. No, it's not. But the inflammatory pl the inflammatory pain and inflammation. I'm going to talk about KPV. Most people have no concept about what to do with KPV, how to use it. You guys, I looked at some of the stuff you guys are are typing in your forums and put me everywhere. I don't care if you guys go this guy. I had somebody go, this is the best part. I I had somebody go, I posted your answers and your facts and everything in a Facebook group and I just about got my head ripped off and I thought that's the that's where you're at. It was about micro doing Reddit truth tide. You're a [ __ ] idiot. If you micro do red tride and just to be clear 0.1 mg every day is micro doing. It's not designed that way. The halflife is 144 hours. It It's a It's 6 days, man. you guys like you're just with your brains don't work. You're like, "I don't care." You're the same ones that go, "Or peptides work for me, bro. I don't care what this guy says." That's like saying, "I put water in my gas tank and it makes my car run. I don't care what you say about internal combustion engines." Okay, I'm not here to convince you. The facts do that all on its own and they make you look like a muppet all on their own. I don't need to worry. It's like arguing with gravity, jumping up in the air and convinced you're not going to come back down. Okay, you should get up to 10,000 feet, open the big sliding door, and you jump with a backpack like that coyote in Roadrunner and Coyote, and I'll jump with a chute, and we'll see which one works because gravity doesn't work for you. It's it's a it's a myth. That's the logic you guys have. It's this irrefutable stupidity. I don't know what to tell you. So, you do you, boo. But I I need to get you guys to understand something about inflammation first because inflammation is there's a dangerous misconception that about inflammation. Inflammation is not the enemy. It's not. And I'll explain what I mean by that because should my wrist be inflamed? I don't know. I don't know if there's an injury in there or not, but at the same time, I'm gonna knock it down as fast as possible because it should be short. But let me say this once again for the Insta experts listening to this and the bro Science and the Jat GBT addicts and all the other people that come out to try and challenge me. I'll go on a stage in front of 10,000 people, nothing more than a chair and a microphone and a bright spotlight, and I will decimate every question. If you ask me questions in my lane, if you ask me stuff about engineering or being an attorney or, you know, I I don't politics, I have no idea. I have no clue. But I'm also not running around saying I do. Everybody wants to be an expert until it's time to be an expert. I'm exceptional at what I do. So, just to address all of you experts who aren't, and especially the pharmaceutical [ __ ] doctors, if you're any of these people, I got nothing but disgust for you. You're a pharmaceutical rep that bought a degree and run around with your white coat. I can't stand you and I've made it my life's mission to burn all your lives to the ground for hurting people that you swore to take care of. Cuz you're not. I don't see you coming out here every day for free helping people. I see you on Tvaia commercials. I see you marketing single and dual agonist GLP1 and GIP because they're FDA approved and you can get them in your clinic. I see you putting people on predinazone 20 40 60 milligrams a day for their systemic inflammation not telling them the truth about what that catastrophe is doing to their system inflammation. So I'm going to tell you exactly what I did with KPB and how I fixed this wrist in two days. It's unbelievable. I will. And listen, we're talking chronic ulcerative colitis, sorry, Crohn's, irritable bowel, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis. The list is endless. So, I'll just go through everything and help you guys out and I'll see if I can bang this out inside of 20, 30 minutes this time instead of an hour. But before I go any further, this isn't meant to cure, treat, advise, prescribe, triage. It's only entertaining, hypothetical, educational. I don't know what else. If you know, you know. I'm getting tired of saying it. in a country that's free and the lie that they spin saying this is for the protection of the public. No, it's not. It's for the protection of the CEOs who make hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars off of the sale that health is managed decline. No, health is health. You guys are just a bag of dicks if you're doing that to people. I have no sympathy for you. I come out here to genuinely help people. You know, the biggest ask I make is just to listen. If you think I'm asking because I go, "Hey, you should uh join the black card." I don't push it. You want the information, join. The link's down in the bottom at the end of the comments somewhere. Go ahead. It's going to cost you six grand until it's not and then it's going to cost 25 grand. Okay? Or don't join. If you go, I just need an answer, bro. Cool. You're still going to join the black card. I'm not going to give it to you. And you can hate on me all you want. Still not going to give it to you. And the other side of that equation is you want to go through peptides. Go to Elite Biogenics or don't. That's on you. That is literally the hardest I push my stuff. I don't run ads. I don't do any stuff. I sit here because I actually give a [ __ ] Maybe you guys will actually get that someday. I don't know. But inflammation is on. Let me get back to this cuz otherwise I'm going to get in one of these moods again. And you know what happens? I just go on for an hour. It's like somebody pulled a string in my chest. Inflammation is literally the most complex and elegant and pretty much lifesaving process that your body possesses. It is the biological equivalent of a national emergency response system. And you are the nation. So when you get injured, your bi your body doesn't send little polite messages back and forth. It sounds every damn alarm that you've got, releases something called a cytoine, which are these chemical signals that cause vasoddilation, expands the vessels, blood vessels allow, so the blood flow increases. The area gets red and hot like my wrist. I took a picture, it was damn near purple. Fluid and white blood cells leak into the tissue, which causes that's what causes the swelling. Nerves become hyper sensitized causing pain. But here's why. It's to force you to protect the area because it's injured or damaged. So, your body is letting you know. This is why you have to pay attention to what your body's telling you. It's letting you know, hey, don't mess with this right now. There's an issue. Let it stand down a little bit. This is called acute acute inflammation. The goal is to isolate the damage, destroy any pathogens if there are any, and remove all of the debris, and initiate the repair. That's the hierarchy of of that's the order. The enemy is when the emergency response team never leaves. It's when it's the tire fire, right? The Simpsons tire fire. When the cleanup crew decides that, which is there, right? The cleanup crew decides that they're going to set up permanent camp at your place. They start eating your food, trashing your car, and eventually they just burn the whole place down out of sheer [ __ ] boredom and misplaced purpose. That's chronic inflammation. And that is a state of chronic, lowgrade, misguided physiological warfare against your own tissues. It has no purpose. None. And no matter how deep you dive into this, no matter how desperately you try and throw scientific words at me, it has no purpose. It is the root cause of our most terrifying modern plagues too. That's the problem is it is causing remember and I've said this before. It is the ao it is the atheroscllerotic plaque the velcro clogging your arteries. It is the amaloid beta tangles that are strangling your neurons in dementia and Alzheimer's. It's the insulin resistance that's rampant everywhere which is polishing up the road for diabetes. It's the mutinogenic environment that you are creating inside your the hostile environment that you're creating to allow cancer cells to go and just get to work and get busy inside you. Chronic inflammation is the rust that weakens the entire machine and you are the machine. So let me let me touch on predinazone for a second because people run to this all the time and a lot of you doctors if you're listening knock it off man. The reason, listen, the reason people don't use peptides the way they should is because number one, they don't know how. And if you go, "Well, nobody teaches us how." I literally keep giving you the option to learn how to do all of this stuff. My Monday Q&A, all I do is field questions for 2 and 1/2 hours about all the stuff you need to know. You're telling me that you're going to go out and you're going to spend 100 grand on a degree in world religion or representative literature? do you. But and then you're going to complain when someone says it's 6 10 15 20 30 grand to learn something that's going to help you become a more robust juggernaut of a human. Okay, make it make sense. I'll wait. Actually, I'm not going to wait. I don't have time to wait for that kind of stupidity. So, let me explain predinazone. It is a synthetic. Right off the bat, bell should be going off. It is a synthetic glucocorticoid. Cortisol is your body's stress hormone. Cortisol is vital. You need cortisone in an acute stress situation. It raises your blood sugar for energy. It modulates inflammation on and off. It helps maintain blood pressure. It's this very finely tuned responsive system. Highly resp. It's a super sensitive system. Predinazone is that system hijacked and weaponized against you. Listen, this is what happens. It gets metabolized in the liver to its active form which is prediniscolone. This molecule so it gets metabolized in the liver to its active form. And now this molecule has an incredibly powerful affinity for glucocorticoid receptors inside the nucleus of almost every single cell in your entire body. So when it binds, it doesn't gently suggest change. It comes in and it acts as a transcription factor, literally altering gene expression of that cell. Except this does this to trillions of cells. it for because you take it orally for Christ's sake, it forces the cell to downregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytoines. So, all of these sound good so far, just bear with me. Sorry, pro-inflammatory proteins like cytoines, chemocines, but at the same time, it upregulates the production of anti-inflammatory proteins and the effect is almost well, it's almost instant. For some of you guys, it's almost instant. The pain vanishes, the swelling goes down, you feel great, and you think you're healed. You just made a deal with Dexter, man, the show, the raging psychopath that goes around and kills people and keeps slides of their blood. That guy, you made a deal with the devil. Because here's the listen, here's the catastrophic collateral damage that happens. And it's a fine print that they're never going to read you. And any doctor worth their sh salt should be telling you this. You get massive adrenal suppression. So your hypoth massive So your hypothalamus and pituitary gland are the master regulators of cortisol production. Okay, there's there's the masterclass portion of this. They operate on this very delicate feedback loop. When they detect synthetic glucocorticoids like predinazone, flooding your system, they panic and they shut down the entire operation. The whole production line goes to it goes tits up. So your adrenal your adrenal glands atrophy. Your body forgets even how to make its own cortisol. This is the addiction. Stop the drug, which is a drug. This is a drug. KPV is not a drug. It's a fragment of a peptide, alpha MSH. And I'll tell I'll talk about that in a second. Stop the drug and your body is left naked, unable to handle even the most minor of stressors. And withdrawal from prennazone, believe it or not, I don't care. It's still fact. Can cause lifethreatening adrenal insufficiency. It's not adrenal fatigue or something like CNS suppression where you guys are like, "My CNS is smoked from a hard workout. It doesn't work like that." Before you get even go even further. Go ahead, get in my comments and hate on me for saying that. No such thing. No such thing. It puts you in a catabolic state. Prennazone. Predinazone activates pathways that break down your own tissue. Promotes proteolyis which is muscle breakdown. Gluconioenesis which creates new sugar. This is the process of creating new sugar. New sugar right? It's not ingested. This is new sugar from your own stuff from protein usually which is muscle. Inhibits osteoblast activity which is what builds your bones. It promotes promotes osteoclast activity which is bone breakdown. Do you see the problem here? So now you get it leads to you've seen it. This is research back. This is the part that drives me crazy. research back. They got so much research that shows that it leads to rapid onset of osteoporosis, causes lipodistrophe. It redistributes the fat to the abdomen and the face. You get a big old moon face and a fat belly while wasting it from your limbs. You guys got to listen to me because I'm not coming out here because I'm trying to pedal some drug. I'm giving you the information to save your life. Hypoglycemia makes your cells completely resistant to insulin, pouring sugar into your bloodstream and pushing you where do you think? I'll give you three three guesses. Diabetes. Diabetes. Diabetes. Yeah, you got it. Diabetes, immunosuppression. This is the one that freaks me out. So when I was a little kid, I don't remember what grade I was in. Fourth, fifth maybe. I was really young. My dad was a school teacher. Listen to me. I still remember Dr. Rejani. I'll never forget it. He was a school teacher. And every second year he would take the German class. There's about 30 kids. I went to this weird private school, but he took the German class with some chaprons and some other teachers to Germany and then toured all over and looked at castles and stuff. it. I mean, we used to go, my mom and I would because my dad was born in in Germany, Noat, and he I mean, his sister still lives there. My dad passed away 13 plus years ago. Sister still lives there. Mom lived there. My dad my Opa passed away when I was one. I was just a baby, so I never really knew him, which sucks. Anyway, the point is is that he would go there all the time. Well, I my mom took me camping and we went to this park and what they had done is they mowed all the poison ivy and there were all these fields. There's poison ivy all over the field. Well, if you've ever had poison ivy, it sucks. My dad could have slept in poison ivy, he'd never get it. Contact dermatitis is what it gives you. But me, oh no, I was so sensitive to that. All of a sudden, I started getting itchy and then I got a little more itchy. And then I got to the point where I was covered essentially from my wrists all the way to my ankles everywhere cuz I was playing in it. It's my neck. It was around my face. I went to Dr. Rejani and they gave me this hydrocortisone cream and I never forgot. I mean this is so many years ago and I I was like a little kid and I remember him saying they couldn't have me on it for longer than 8 to 10 days. I don't remember what it was because it's so immunosuppressive and he was very concerned. I remember him going do not no matter what. Think about it now. They put people on prennazone for months. That's back when medical doctors actually did their [ __ ] job, looked out for the patient. And I was a kid like of all any and my mom would put it on because I couldn't even put it on. And I would sit there and watch movies with my wrists with my in with my knees up on the couch and my hands on my wrists. And they would just weep. I had this crust all over me. I was nasty. And we almost couldn't go I almost couldn't go to see my dad to hang out with my with my dad in Germany because I was so bad. I got a fever and everything. It was brutal. So, just to give you an idea, that's how bad predinazone is. And even the doc was like, "Don't do it for very long. This stuff's real nasty." But think of the problems it's causing, right? Immunosuppression. It doesn't It doesn't just listen, it doesn't just calm down an overactive immune system. This scares the crap out of them. It demolishes a functional one that's doing its job, running constant surveillance to keep you alive, fighting off things that you don't even know are attacking you. It causes lymphocytoenia which means it kills your white blood cells leaving you vulnerable to pretty much every opportunistic infection that can have infection that can happen from thrush to life-threatening sepsis. It doesn't matter what it is. You can get it all. Prennazone is the equivalent of solving a termite problem in our house by torching the entire house. Okay, the termites are gone, but so is the entire damn house and everything in it. You want to look at something that's going to help you equal. I would I'll put KPV versus predinazone side by side. any day of the week. Any day of the week, all day. Unless it is a life ordeath matter that's going to I need predinazone to save a life. There are very very very very few instances that require that. No matter what some knucklehead doctor you can tell I don't have a I have been a doctor for a long decades. And you know what? I got no respect for 99% of you guys. None. I don't care if you like me or not. You guys are a bunch of [ __ ] frauds. You're frauds. And even then, even then, listen, I will take a personal trainer. I will take somebody who has I have people in my group who they have no credentiing. You guys in your putting value in credentials. What in the hell is wrong with you? I can find people that are personal trainers personally that I know that are much far more intelligent and far more effective as a diagnostician as easily 90% of the medical doctors in the world. Smoke on that. I got no sympathy for you. Don't you guys walk around with your arrogance and your degrees? [ __ ] your degrees. How about you? Actually, I'm over a million patients. I'm over a million patients that I've worked with. All verifiable. What are you at? You know why I have that many? Because I care. Because I damn well care. You guys drive me nuts. KPV is like the smart bomb of the of the century. It's a tripeptide. It's a sequence of three amino acids, lysine, proline, and veene. It's not some synthetic alien molecule. It's a fragment a very precise piece of a larger which I already talked about this naturally occurring hormone in your body called alpha melanocyt stimulating hormone alpha msh alpha MSH is the master regulator of inflammation pigmentation really and energy homeostasis the balance of your energy KPV constitutes the C terminal sequence of alpha MSH and has been proven through tons of research so much research that this fragment contains the core anti-inflammatory activity of the entire parent mole molecule the alpha MSH. So think of think of Alpha MSH as I don't know the president. You guys are oh what don't use him. Relax with your politics. It's an example. Okay. As the president with a very broad command structure. KPV is the president's Delta force. And they're the most decorated, most precise, most lethal special forces. And it's just single like one operative. It's like Rambo. And it the KPV is given a very high value target and it's authorized to use extreme prejudice. That's how this works. So the target is only one thing. It's IL1 beta. So interlucan one beta. This is a cytoine of epic proportions because it's like a giant arsonist in your immune system. It sits at the very top of the inflammatory cascade and it's a primary driver of fever, pain, vasoddilation, and tissue destruction in just about every disease out there. Most anti-inflammatories, here's the problem. Most anti-inflammatories like NSAIDs, right, non-steridal anti-inflammatory drugs, so things like ibuprofen, Tylenol, etc., they work downstream. So, they try and mop up the mess after IL1 beta has already flooded the building. So, they're out there with with buckets and mops trying to get the mess cleaned up, and they can't do it very well. So, they inhibit something called a COX enzyme and they reduce prostinon production. That's like trying to bail water out of a boat that's already got a giant hole in it. KPV doesn't bail out any water. You know what KPV does? It finds the guy that's drilling the [ __ ] holes and breaks both his hands. That's how badass this stuff is. KPV's primary action is the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammosomes. The NLRP3 inflammosome is this multi-proin complex that that acts like a molecular machine inside immune cells like macrofasages, right? So KPV comes in and sabotages the [ __ ] out of this machine. It prevents the assembly or the activity does both. It prevents it from being built or even doing its job of NLRP3 inflammosome. But by doing that, it stops the production of what do you think? IL1 beta at the source. No assembly line, no product. It shuts down the factory and then bombs the factory so it can't produce it. And if you go, "What? What if it's needed?" Listen, this isn't permanent destruction. Your body is this dynamic machine that keeps replacing things. But the genius of KPV doesn't stop just at the mechanism of action. It's in its delivery because the pharmacocinetics of this thing, it's like a masterclass in precision. It works so well. So when you inject KPV subcutaneously, it doesn't just float around aimlessly in your system. It inflamed and damaged tissue. Follow me. This is important because your body is always pumping out signals which are proteins by the way. Inflammatory or inflamed and damaged tissue regardless of its location in the body under goes very specific physiological changes. Upregulates the expression of certain transporters and exhibits an increased vascular permeability. And it does this all for a reason. But KPV is drawn to these areas. It's like a magnet. It's like the radar's on like it finds these things. It's this phenomenon called targeted delivery or sight specificity. the inflamed tissue which is screaming with biochemical distress signals, right? Just beep beep beep. It actively pulls KPV out of the bloodstream. So it is so fantastic because healthy perfectly functional tissue ignores it. It doesn't even see it. Which means that subcutaneous injection of KPV acts as a systemic search and destroy mission without searching and destroying anything that doesn't need to be sought out or destroyed. The molecule circulates through the entire body, but its effects are concentrated precisely where they're needed the most. This is polar opposite of predinazone coming in with wartthogs and carpet bombing the entire body. And it's not theoretical, by the way. This is physiological fact. Look at So, there's some things I just wanted to touch on because look at inflammatory bowel disease. Uh, Crohn's, ulcerative nucleitis, things like that. So the in the intestinal mucosa of IBD and inflammatory bowel disease is it's like a it's like numb man like it's just napal and agent orange and machine guns. The epithelial barrier is comprised and the epithelial barrier is compromised. The immune cells are in this state of constant chaotic activation producing this storm of TNF alpha and IL6 and of course IL1 beta. And a study, listen to this, here's the best part. study journal of pharmarmacology and experimental therapeutics used a model with mice with colitis. So follow me. So so far we're on the same page right with colitis. One group got subcutaneous injections of KPB while the other group got injections of saline for the control. The results were unbelievable. The KPV group showed a dramatic dose dependent reduction in the disease activity indices. So they would the indices the things that happen weight loss, diarrhea, bleeding. So here's the best part hisystological examination of the colon tissue showed massive protection, significantly less mucosal erosion, almost no ulceration, and no inflam no infiltration of inflammatory cells from KPV. The KPV didn't just reduce the number on the chart, right? It didn't just change something that you get to see on a white paper. It actively preserved the architectural integrity of the damn gut wall by shutting down the NLRP3 IL1 beta axis at the site of infl [ __ ] You know what can't say that? Skyrizzy, which is currently the BS they use to treat IBD and any TNF blockers. What did I just say? The storm of TNF alpha and IL6 and of course ILB or IL1B are what are flooding the system. They're putting in a TNF blocker, but they're not solving the problem because they aren't solving the IL1 beta problem. The IL1 beta problem is where the issue is, which means you need to handle NLRP3. If you don't handle that, it doesn't matter what you're doing because you're fixing the problem downstream, which means it's still being produced. You're just getting in the way as it comes down the line. How long can you sustain that? You didn't fix the problem. Skyrizzy not doing damn bit of good. Yes, it pisses me off because the industry is so set up for you guys to lose. Look at rheumatoid arthritis. It's an autoimmune attack on sinovial joints. The senovium becomes a proliferative inflamed that invades and destroys cartilage and bone. IL1 beta is a master regulator of this entire process. I got to drink some more coffee. It stimulates sinovial cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs, and I'll get to that in a second. The enzymes that literally chew up and eat and digest cartilage. Research using collagen induced arthritis models in mice showed this. There's so many. There's probably at least a hundred of these studies. I'm not going to give them to you cuz I don't have time and I really don't care. Look them up yourself. The beauty of the internet is you can stop using it to look up porn and you can start using it to look up what you need to so you can have a better damn life. But they showed that subcutaneous administration again subq. You can't take the stuff orally. You can use it rectily. Yes, I will put that out there, but not nearly as effective. But of KPV reduced the clinical severity of arthritis. They had paws, not hands. So the pulse paw swelling was virtually non-existent. But more importantly, here's the best part. Micro, tiny little CT scans showed profound reduction in bone erosion, which means that the bones weren't being chewed up by the MMPs. If the bones are being chewed up, you're saving your tissue. You're saving your tissue. Your tissue is growing. Your tissue is healing. Your tissue is working. It protected the joint structure by neutralizing the primary cytoine responsible for the damn instruction, the damn destruction. How about reinvoke? Not a chance. Can it keep up with these results? None of the TN, it's like I said, none of the TNF blockers even make sense because of the physiology I just explained. Yes, it gets me riled up because I I genuinely give a [ __ ] about people that give a [ __ ] about themselves. Like look at psoriasis, man. People look at it as a skin disease. It's not. Psoriasis is a systemic IL23, IL7 driven inflammatory condition with skin manifestations. It shows up out here. The problem is in here. Caratinosytes, the skin cells, they are spooled up to hyperp proliferation, which means they just make a ton of them. and subcutaneous. Again, KPV systematically modulates the immune response which reduces if not eliminates the scaling, the arythma and the plaque thickness of psoriasis. It works from the inside out. I don't know if you understand your body doesn't work from the outside in. It works from the inside out. Above, down, inside out. The brain controls everything. The body lets it show, right? It calms the immune dysregulation that causes the skin to behave pathologically. Steroid creams for an internal problem. Steroid creams for an internal problem. Really? Okay, got it. Make it make sense. Fibromyalgia is one that I see a lot. I struggle with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. It's one in because there's a lot of other factors to this. There's some psychological factors that come into play on this, but the problem is still real, but the paradigm for this has shifted slightly. It's it's a central it's now thought of as a central sensitivity syndrome that's characterized by CNS windup right so gal cells in the brain and the spinal cord become chronically hyperactivated they release inflammatory cytoines including IL1 beta into the CNS this neuroinflammation reduces the pain threshold remember what I said when so I was using my wrist example it hypersensitizes nerves so you protect the area so this neuroinflammation lowers the pain threshold because of what I was talking about, right? Which leads to all um which leads to aladmia which is bodywide pain. It's pain from non painful stimuli. So wearing a shirt, putting on these bracelets, things like that. And hyperalesa, which is amplified pain. So now you get pain from things don't normally cause pain and the pain is amplified. So you get where I'm going. This is the problem. So KPV with its tiny little molecular weight has the ability to cross something called the bloodb brain barrier. Bloodb brain bar. You get across this and magic happens. So subcutaneous delivery allows it to do all the things that it needs to on the CNS, the central nervous system where it dampens gleal cell activation and the subsequent neuroinflammatory cascade that shows up that causes what? The aladmia and the hyperalesia. It addresses listen it addresses the root cause of the pain amplification. This is not a not just a perception of pain that it's handling. It's actually dampening the pain. What do they use? Come on, man. They use prennazone. They use Lica, Zimbalta, none of which solve the problem. They work downstream. Make it make sense. You can't can't. KPV is literally batting a thousand. From the gut to the joints, from the skin all the way to your brain, it doesn't matter. The common pathogenic thread is the disregulation and or the disregulated activation of the innate immune system, usually because of the NLRP3 inflammosone and the IL1 beta. That's exactly how this works. So, if you handle the machine in the factory and blow it up so it doesn't cause all these problems, do you solve the problem? Yeah, you solve the problem. But now your body can go back to healing itself. KPV is a master key that fits all of this stuff that this is locked out that you're locked out of, which is why all of these drugs aren't working. They're not doing what they're supposed to be doing. You have to understand inflammation. Please, you guys, just KPV is one of the coolest things in the world. And just so you know, I shouldn't even tell you this. 100 to 500 micrograms at the site subcutaneously, not long-term. That's all I'll give you. The rest, I'm tired of you guys. You want to beg me for dosages, just join. Stick a crowbar in your wallet and you know what? Throw something towards the guy that's doing all the work to make sure you have the real answers, not some broc science jackass on Reddit that thinks they know what they're talking about because they have apps. So, I just gave you the dosage in case you're trying to figure out what I just did. 100 to 500 micrograms at the site, one to two times a day at the most. You're welcome. Listen, chronic lowgrade inflammation is the single most powerful predictor for the most part of all cause mortality. It is it is this this biological background noise that accelerates every single aging pathway. It makes you older faster and makes you rust quicker. So, by effectively and safely, cuz it's there if you need it, right? Acute inflammation. Yes, chronic inflammation. No, but you're being sold that chronic inflammation is something that happens and it requires what? Manage decline. [ __ ] By effectively and safely resolving the inflammation, you're not not just treating a disease. You're engaging in preventative medicine at the very root of the problem of every other disease. You're actively decelerating the aging process. You're protecting your heart, your brain, your metabolism, your kidneys, your cellular integrity. I don't know, make it make sense to not do this. Prennazone trades short-term symptom relief for long-term systemic catastrophe. KPV doesn't just block a pathway. It restores the order of the machine. It tells your immune system with impeccable timing and precision that the job is done. It doesn't need to be inflamed anymore. It's the green light that you're trying to get when something is hyperinflamed. I don't know what else to tell you, but KPV is one of the most effective things I've ever seen. It doesn't work in the same way as BPC-157, by the way. But if you put together BPC57, hypothetically for a kangaroo experiment, BPC157, TB500, GHKCU, and KPV, and if it's a soft tissue injury, PEG MGF, that's the closest thing to Wolverine I can think of. Anyway, I hope you guys got something out of this. If not, oh well. Thanks for giving me 40 minutes of your day. I got to go. Never miss.
