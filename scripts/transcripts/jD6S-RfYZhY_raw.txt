We need to talk. All of us. We need to talk because you guys are being indoctrinated. And you have been the most dogmatic viewpoint that is destroying your health and your life. I come out here because above all do no harm. I take very seriously. Whether it's my marriage, my fitness, my business, elite biogenics, my company, whether it's the black card, my company, whether it's Spartan Army, my it doesn't matter. Smashworks, body hacks, all of them. Or taking care of you. I take what I do very seriously and we need to talk about something that's going to fundamentally alter your understanding of medicine, not just medicine, of disease management, and why you are probably being poisoned right now by something that your doctor gave you. And I'm not being edgy, you guys. I'm being factual. And you guys are going to go, "Oh, here we go." But listen, there are people on social media right now, MDs, PhDs, screaming against peptides, basing it solely on human trials in the FDA. But the FDA is the enforcer for the cartel called Big Pharma. Listen, let me ask you, just follow me. Let me ask you a question. if pharmaceutical drugs were actually designed to make you healthy. Just let me explain this because I've been a doctor for almost three decades. I've seen over 1 million patients and yet somebody with a PhD that's read 70 books who's never seen a patient ever is labeled as more of an expert. Make it make sense just because that's like saying, you know what, so one of my buddies, Tom Delas, he's an excellent jiu-jitsu fighter. He is so good. And if I read books for 10 years on jiu-jitsu and I became an expert and I got straight A's 4.0 and I have a black belt in reading about jiu-jitsu and I got on the mat, he's going to murder me. And if he's never read a book on jiu-jitsu, but he's done nothing but practice it, he's better. I find it absolutely disgusting that there is a board of medical examiners, that there's a board of chiropractic examiners, that the American Medical Association exists because those are all control factors to tell you what you are and what you are not allowed to do when it comes to helping people. Yet being a doctor means above all do no harm. And that's just that's not just being a medical doctor. That is being a human being. That's being a man or a woman, but in this case, I'm talking about a man. They don't want you healthy. And there is such a massive war against peptides because they're dipping into the massive profit margin. And it's not the initial profit margin. You guys are looking at it far too superficially. You need to take the thousand foot view because you're looking at it as going, "Well, yeah, because peptides are dipping into their profits." No, they're not. They make so much money off of your ignorance. They want you to be a patient for life. And they've convinced you so well. Like Stalin, right? Rip the feathers out of the chicken, bloodied, beat up. Throw a little bit of food down and the chicken follows him around anyway. even after he just beat that bird. That's how you guys are thinking. Please listen to me. If you want to get in my comments and run your mouth like a toddler, you go right ahead. What I'm telling you is that for there's a lady right now. She made a post about how peptides there's no credible research and everything is on rats and hedgehogs or whatever it is she's saying and she's but look at me. I'm a PhD in neuroscience, etc. I don't care. I don't care. you are on the quest to find the to go against Alzheimer's but yet I've got people in my group MS gone dementia gone Alzheimer's reduced easily 60 70% but yet I'm not using anything no Aer aisep no mena or prennazone the struggle I'm having is that they don't want you healthy and they know it but you guys are fighting thinking that they have your best interest in mind have you learned nothing in the last four and a half years like I said these are just facts baby let me ask you a question if this is the case if pharmaceutical drugs were actually designed to make you healthy. Why then are they the leading cause of death in America? If you look at the facts, third, however, watch, I'll explain why I said it's the not third. And this is after heart disease and cancer, which pharmaceutical drugs often cause and it is proven the number three killer is called ADR. ADR stands for adverse drug reactions. So, this is I'll go back, listen, I'll even give you the benefit of it. Now, go back 15 years. Journal of American Medical Association Published data, you guys, showed 217,000 people per year die from ADRs in hospitals alone. That's not even including outpatient deaths, baby. Just for context, that's about a Boeing 747 fully loaded with people, two of them, smoking the ground every day and killing every single one of them. Nobody talks about it, though. You guys are all out there attacking peptides like you have anything. You know what it is? Mob mentality. You got to get your licks in. You ever listen to Matt Refe? I love Matt Refe. Matt Refe is a frigin stud. If you don't like him, I don't care. I love Matt. And you know what he says? He made a comment when he was sitting on a plane on Twitter about his bag being under his feet instead of not fitting under his seat. And then he said, "Look what I can do with his feet." It was hilarious. And he made a post about the rules and how ridiculous they were. And 700 plus people went bananas trying to get their licks in on him because they all want to get their licks in because they're mad at themselves. Maybe you guys should look at yourselves. If you're on anything more than one drug, you should not be on any. By the way, if you're on any drugs, you should look at your life because they are not solving the problem. Here's how you know they worked. Can you stop taking them? If you can't stop taking them, the problem isn't solved. It's managed. You are a profit machine. But nobody talks about that. Instead, the FDA bans peptides. You need to understand why. And in order to do that, you need to understand something fundamental, which is how drugs work versus how peptides actually work. Because once you understand the distinction, everything else. So, a drug is like a sledgehammer. Period. And I'm not saying, listen, if I'm missing a lung, okay? There were drugs that allowed me to be anesthetized. There were drugs that allowed me to recover. There were drugs that allowed me to survive. There were drugs that allowed me to beat the infection. But I'm not taking them anymore. There's no managed decline. In fact, they gave me 12 prescriptions. 12. 12. and said I was going to be on all of those for the rest of my life was one of them. That was a $900 prescription. They said if I don't take it, I'm going to have a clot and I'm going to die. 100% guaranteed. It's absolutely imperative that I take that for the rest of my life. Make it make sense. I'm almost 5 years out now. In August, it'll be 5 years. This March next month I turn 53. They said I would never run. I would probably have strugg I'd be walking with a cane. That's what they said almost 5 years ago. If you've ever seen me train, you know that's a lie because I can run a sub 22 minute 5K. I run every day in a weighted vest every morning. I do a 100 pull-ups, 100 squats, 100 push-ups, and 100 bicycles every morning. And I run a mile every morning. I've been doing that for years. It's not my workout. I do it because I can. I do it because I demand more of myself than anybody else. I do it because I will not let somebody else tell me what I can and can't do. Which is the same reason why when you come to me with your problem and you go, "Listen, I have dementia. I have cancer. I have a sore throat. I don't care. I need to get rid of type two diabetes, which I have solved thousands and thousands of times. I will do everything in my power to make sure." The only thing that you can do to make sure it doesn't work is not listen to me. And I don't gatekeep anything. I give you everything for free even then. But if you want to like with a black card with Elite Biogenics, Elite Biogenics is my company. You want to buy from my company? Great. Everything is tested, goshic tested well. Everything I would give my wife and kids are the same things that my lab creates for you. But why? But you'll run out and buy like COX one and two inhibitors, NSAIDs, beta blockers, which have a FDA black label warning on them for people with asthma, by the way, because they cause death. Celre, which was taken off the market. I could do this all day, but they were deemed safe. Even this, you talk about this on social media, and you get flagged, banned, post throttled, cancelled, because people are mad that they're so ignorant, stupid that they keep falling for it. Maybe the next drug will be the good one. Cancer, they burn you, slice you, poison you, and they've done the same thing. Yet, the rate of cancer has gone through the roof. But you're treating it better. You're finding it better. No, you're renaming the same thing over and over again. Cancer is always the same thing. It's always the same thing. Three biological failures: systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and an ATP shortage. And next thing, the Warberg effect kicks off. 1931, Otto Warberg won the Nobel Prize. 1924, he discovered it. And he went, "Wow, fermentation. That's where cells go." And instead of producing 30 plus, they produce 2 ATP. They're inefficient. They can't change. Their mitochondria is damaged. Their genetics of the DNA is damaged. So when they are forced to function in normal, they can't. So they automatically die because your genetics go, you either fix yourself or you self-destroy apoptosis. And the cells don't have a choice cuz they can't fix themselves. So they die. But instead, they give you chemotherapy. Chemotherapy. Okay, make it make sense. Chemotherapy hasn't saved anybody. I'm tired of people saying it. No, it hasn't. People die from organ failure, by the way, from chemotherapy. It's proven. Not from the cancer, from the organ failure. Listen, if I would have listened to them, I'd be dead. So, I take this very seriously. So, if you want to buy from Elite Biogenics, great. I don't come out here to market to any of you. If you go, "Oh, yes, you do. You market all the time." I don't run a single ad. Not one. The most advertising I do is on one of my research papers that says, "Click here if you want anything. You want to join my black card? Great. It's $9,997. Apply at unlockthecar.com. Email Mia. She is my gangster executive assistant. She'll get you all set up. It's wire only. I told you just the other day I had a guy tell me that I he's got no multiple sclerosis anymore. You want to see something? Here, I'll show you. This is exactly what happens. Maybe you guys should just pay the [ __ ] attention to what I say cuz it bugs me. Here, let's do this. I have one of my one of my one-on-one clients. These guys spent a quart million dollars to work with me for a year straight. I just want you to see this feedback in April. This is not I'm not making this up. Back in April 2025, my wife had blood work done and her Anna so Anna and found it said anti-uclear antibodies screening said that she was positive for autoimmune disease. They were going to treat her. We didn't dig any deeper into it. Instead, per your recommendations, I put her on the exact protocol that you gave her for 3 months. She got blood work last week. This was on January 30th, just so you know. She got blood work last week and it came back negative. Thank you. You guys can keep on believing that getting in my comments and trash talkinging and all the idiotic things that you do. I'm not out here to make money. I'm out here to help you. I'm not out here to advertise. I'm out here to help you. And do you understand that help? Yes, it does come with a price because you're taking time away from my wife and my kids if I'm out here helping you. But I'm still going to help you. I'm just going to make sure they have something in return. So take it however you want. I really don't care. Maybe some of you guys are I thought you were going to tell me how to dosem C. Then I am tracking I'm attracting the wrong crowd. Cuz if that's all you think I'm going to do, then you're missing out because I'm far more intelligent than that. Listen, here's the fundamental problem with pharmaceuticals. They're not trying to restore your biology. They're not. They're trying to mask symptoms by chemically interfering with it. That's not the same. Let me give you an example. Something that everybody understands. How about this? I was just talking about this. Beta blockers for hypertension. Okay, let's go through that. Your blood pressure is elevated. By the way, they keep changing the number. It's astronomically low now. It's ridiculous. 140 over 90 normal. Your blood pressure changes a thousand plus times a day. So, stop thinking you need to be 110 over 70. That UNL is a BS phrase, just so you know, within normal limits. Your blood pressure is elevated. Okay, so why? Let's go through this. Let's go line by line because I'll bet I can figure this out for you right now and solve all your problems. Probably because you have endothelial dysfunction, which means your arterial lining isn't producing enough nitric oxide. You have chronic inflammation, inflammatory molecules destroying the inside of your blood vessels. Sympathetic nervous system is hyperactive. So your stress response is cranked on. Your skinny pedal is down. Your sympathetic nervous system is firing so hard it can't even see straight. Vascular smooth muscle dysfunction. Your blood vessel walls don't know how to relax because they can't. And your insulin resistant, which causes sodium retention and fluid volume expansion. These are actual biological problems, you guys. A beta blocker comes in, and this is the issue. It doesn't solve any of that. It says, "I don't give a crap about any of that. I'm going to block the beta 2 adonurgic receptors on your heart and on your blood vessels. Your heart's going to beat slower. Your vessels will constrict less. your blood pressure number will go down. And here's the thing, it works. Your blood pressure does go down. That's like looking at HBA1C and thinking it's a valid number, by the way. I'll get to that in a minute. But you haven't fixed anything if your blood pressure number goes down. You've just prevented your sympathetic nervous system from doing its job. Now, your heart is beating slower, which means less perfusion to the extremities, to your tissues, right? Your fatigue goes through the roof. Your exercise tolerance tanks. Your sexual function gets impaired because beta blockers are notorious for erectile dysfunction. Meanwhile, the underlying endothelial dysfunction still there. Inflammation still there. Insulin resistance, oh yeah, baby, that's still there. So now you've massed a number while destroying your quality of life and never addressing the root cause, which are the three biological failures of all freaking diseases. This is how every pharmaceutical works. Symptom masking through chemical warfare interference. Look at statins. They block HMGCOA reductase which stops your liver from making cholesterol. Your chole your brain, you know, your brain is total cholesterol, right? It's just a big piece of cholesterol between your ears. So, your cholesterol number goes down. But the Framingham study already proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that is a ridiculous thing to do and catastrophically harmful for your health. But cholesterol is not the problem. Oxidized cholesterol in inflamed endothelium is the problem. Your inflammation is still there. It's probably worse now because statins themselves are pro-inflammatory in the mitochondri at the mitochondrial level. Look at research from the journal of the American College of Cardiology 2002 showed statins reduce CoQ10 which impairs mitochondrial function. Never mind the fact that statins when you take them make you dumb. It's the easiest way to explain it. Brain fog is one of the most prominent side effects. But people I told you I have a real one of my closest friends a doctor that he does not use anymore said you got to get on statins. Your cholesterol is too high. Made me want to throw things at her. the doctor, not him. Look at PPIs, proton pump inhibitors. I'm going to do this, so if this is uncomfortable for you, buckle up. They block acid production in your stomach. Okay, so your acid reflux goes away, but you've just eliminated one of your body's primary immune defenses and disabled proper nutrient absorption. Awesome. So now you're deficient in B12, magnesium, and calcium. By the way, that is proven. Journal of Gastroenterology, 2010 proved that's what happens when you take PPIs, but people go, "I'm just going to take it anyway because I don't like the little owies I have here." Maybe change everything else so your biology works. Look at NSAIDs. blocks the production of prostaglandins. So, your pain goes down, but prostaglandins are protecting your GI mucosa, maintaining renal blood flow, kidneys, and regulating immune functions. Just destroyed all of that. Don't worry, I'm going to touch on this because you guys are going to go, "Wait a minute. I take an Advil every day before I work out." You're not going to live very long if you do that. The pattern is always the same. Take something your body needs, block it, watch one symptom improve while 10 others develop. Trying to maintain composure because this pisses me off. I've lost people that I love dearly because they've taken medications and they've died because of it. Just compare this to how peptides actually work. For all the muppets out there arguing against peptides, peptide, short chain of amino acids, biological molecule, the way your body communicates with itself when you introduce it into your system. It's not trying to block a damn thing. It's trying to restore biological function that's degraded and it's using a signal that your body already knows. How about we use one that everybody, this knucklehead on social media is attacking, BPC7, body protection compound 157. Your body naturally produces small amounts of BP-157 in your gastric juices. No, it cannot be taken orally. I'm tired of everybody asking me that. No, it can't. I've already gone over the mechanism and why. Regenerates damaged gastric mucosa. Let's just go through this line by line. Restores tight junctions in your intestinal lining. You need those. Promotes angioenesis, which is new blood flow formation in damaged tissues. Reduces inflammatory cytoines alpha, IL6, I1 beta that cause oh, they're pretty much the basis of 95% of all chronic disease. enhances growth hormone secretion and makes you violently sensitive to IGF-1. Improves wound healing. I could do this all day, but yet there's not. And that's the problem. So, if you have IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, leaky gut, or a dadinal ulcer, these are fundamentally problems of mucosal degradation and barrier dysfunction. Your body's natural BPC1 production is inefficient or you're in an inflammatory state that's overwhelming it. That's it. So when you introduce exogenous BPC157, you're not blocking a damn thing. What What are you blocking with your biology, you're not interfering with your biology, you're restoring it. So let me get this straight. Look at research of pharmarmacology 2018 showed that BPC57 accelerated gastric ulcer healing with zero adverse effects. Zero. And without the immunosuppression or nutrient malabsorption that PPIs always cause 100% of the time. Or take TB500 or thymus and beta 4. Use the real version, the full thing, not the seven, the 43 amino acid chain. Naturally occurring peptide that your body produces but decreases with age. TB500 thymus and beta 4's job promote cardiac. By the way, it is the only one proven to reverse fibrosis in the moardium. It heals. It reverses athletes heart. If you listen to my stud my post on asthma yesterday, it is one of the common side effects of asthma is hypertrophy. left or right ventricular rather hypertrophy. You don't want that. Thyson beta 4 promotes cardiac angioenesis. Prevents cardiomyasite apoptosis cell death reduces inflammation IL10 upregulation. Anti-inflammatory interlucan promotes soft tissue repair and neurogenesis or neurons improves blood flow and oxygen delivery. If you have heart disease, TB500 isn't trying to block a symptom. It's trying to restore cardiac regeneration and reduce the inflammation that caused the damage in the damn first place. The American Journal of Pathology 2008 showed TB500 improved postinfar cardiac function by promoting angioenesis and reducing apoptosis actually regenerating heart tissue not just managing the symptoms which is what your cardiologist is going to do. This is a very fundamental difference. Drugs equal chemical interference with broken biology. Peptides equal restoration of natural biological function. One destroys the quality of your life while never addressing the problem. And the other restores your biology to what it's supposed to be doing in the first place. Let me give you some actual statistics because they're staggering. 200,000 plus per year. By the way, if you go back to JAMA 2000, 106,000 deaths per year, and that is 26 years ago. Add outpatient deaths and you're probably north of millions. Therapeutic deaths. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center 2004 published data showing that 10% of cancer patients die directly from chemotherrapeutic toxicity. That is not even close to the number. But it's not from cancer progression. Even that is far too high. I call that number a poly. That's roughly, just so you know, 50,000 people per year in America alone from the treatment. Oh, it gets worse when you add in the patients who die from secondary cancers caused by chemotherapy, chemotherrapeutic induced cancer or infections from chemotherapy induced immunosuppression or organ damage that kills them years later. The actual death toll is staggering seven figures. Look at vaccine adverse events. Oh, I'm sure this podcast is going to get ripped on by some sensor. Accuting to according to VE's vaccine adverse event reporting system even pure review so many documented cases of blood clotting disorders myocarditis serious adverse events following the mna C19 vaccine you know where they mostly occurred to younger groups American heart journal 2021 published data on postvcination myocarditis incidents alone they said 13,000 deaths attributed to vaccines but they go the causality is debated though you know that Canada just locked up all vaccine information for 25 years. Did you know that? Why? All records locked for 25 years. Why? Listen, even if you're skeptical of causality attribution, the fact remains that there is not a zero risk intervention. And if you go nothing has zero risk, tell me how many people have died of peptides. Just tell me. I'll wait. Go ahead. Give me the number. We know that vaccines cause harm. It's not zero risk. Remember what I said about Celra at the beginning? Proved as the safer NSAID. The FDA eventually added a blackbox warning for cardiovascular and GI risks and then they pulled it. Increased myioardial unfortunate stroke risk 10,000 plus deaths that they are telling you about 100% attributable to Celre before the warning journal of the American Medical Association 2003. Look at oxycottton oxycodone and extended release tabs right marketed as this as safer because of extended release formulation directly contributed to the opioid epidemic. CDC estimates over a half a million deaths from opioid overdose alone. Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty to criminal charges. They knew it was addictive. They knew it. They damn well knew it. They gave it to you anyway. Yeah, this bugs me cuz I have a good friend of mine that got caught in that trap. And if you go, well, he's just got a problem. He's still a good man. Look at Nsaides. The American Journal of Gastroenterology, 16,500 NSAID related deaths per year from GI bleeding alone in the United States alone. Add cardiovascular vets. Just so you know, NSAIDes increase, you ready for this? And they go take aspirin every day. Listen, just so you know, NSAIDs increase MI, myioardial inffection, and stroke risk by 50%. So why are they getting you to take an aspirin every day? You're looking at anywhere from 50 to 100,000 deaths annually. You guys just keep spoon feeding yourselves with this stuff, too. Look at PPIs, proton pump inhibitors, increased risk of fractures. British Medical Journal 2010, cardiovascular events, chronic kidney disease. American Journal of Gastroenterology 2017 said estimated 50,000 hospitalizations annually from PPI related complications. Total pharmaceutical related deaths, conservative estimate, 2 million per year in the United States alone. Now, how many people have died from peptides? Come on, give me the number. Oh, wait. What do you got? What are you going to say? That people don't report them. They die in their sleep somewhere because they took too much PPC. Zero. Zero. Not rare. Not very uncommon. You guys, it is zero. I need you to take this seriously because I take my life and I take your life very seriously. The most comprehensive review of peptide safety published in the Journal of Peptide Science 2019 showed adverse events from peptides were extraordinarily rare and typically mild. Transient headache. You ready for this? These are brutal. You better buckle up. Transient headache, slight nausea, temporary injection, slight irritation. Are you going to be able to handle that compared to NSAIDs, chemotherapy, and opioids where we're getting into the millions per year of deaths? Zero deaths. Zero. That's a good side effects, baby. How many times have you heard somebody say, "Listen, you look at Elite Biogenics, CO side effects might occur." No, you don't hear that. You look at any of the companies that sell peptides, you'll never hear that because they don't exist. How about we look at the actual side effect profiles because you hear them for 45 seconds while some family is playing Frisbee with their dog snipples in the park. Most common side effects from pharmaceutical drugs, ironically, is iatrogenic disease, meaning disease caused by the treatment itself. The Journal of American Medical Association estimates that estimates that 25,000 hospitalized patients experience adverse drug re drug reactions. So, I want you to think about that number right now. 25%. So, if 25% of your family was taken away right now, I know some of you guys be like, "Oh, I'd be so happy. You're an idiot. Don't act like that because one day it would happen to you're going to freak out." If you've seen Labyrinth and you know that when her little brother gets taken away and she freaks out. Yeah, exactly. So, don't Man, there's a great movie with David Bowie, by the way, if you don't know what it is. Old. I'm old. I'm 52. 25% of your paycheck, 25% of your health, 25% of your physical body was all taken away. I don't care if you're overweight. That's not what I'm talking about. If your arm was taken, just understand that means one in four people in a hospital are being there being harmed by their own medications. So, what are the side effects? How about this? GI bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anti-coagulants. Myioardial inffion, heart attack, NSAIDs. Diabetic drugs cause this. Stroke Nsaides. Hormone replacement therapy. Huh? Wait a minute. Back up on that. HRT. Let's touch on that for a second. So, HRT, the thing that they're saying that some other doc out there on social media. God, I hope you hear this. I hope you hear this and you go, this is the guy that doesn't know anything about menopause. I know everything about menopause. Oz. All diseases. Why? because they follow my three biological failures. Because I care about you, because I love you. Oh, not that doctor. You, as are the people listening to this? Do you think I come out here for myself? I've got about a thousand things I'd rather be doing than this. But I do this because I give a crap about mankind. Because God left me here to drop all this information, to give you everything you've got to have the most badass life you possibly can and turn you into a freaking juggernaut. That's why. That's why. Stroke, HRT. It doesn't matter if they go, "That only happens to 1%. 1% is too much. Peptides zero. Liver toxicity, acetaminophen, by the way, statins, methtoresate, a chemotherapeutic drug that they use off label for, huh, rheumatoid arthritis for one thing, got public kidney damage, nsaides, ACE inhibitors affect that. Look at muscle pain and weakness, notorious. Myalgia is notorious with statins. I'm just ripping these off the top of my head. Cognitive impairment, bzzoazipines, Xanax, Valium, right? Anticolonergics, sexual dysfunction. Really? I'm going to tell you, my wife is so hot. I love having sex with my wife. I would not want to be all wrecked physically and then have somebody go, "That's just normal because you're 52." No, it's not. Only if you're taking crazy medications, beta blockers, SSRIs, and antisycchotics. By the way, you know what? They give SSRIs and antisycchotics for PTSD. But I think I know a doc. He looks a lot like me, wears the same hat, speaks like me, has a beard, same age. Wait, it is me who solved it for free. metabolic dysfunction, antiscychotics, and cortosteroids. That means you are a big giant type 2 diabetic. And these aren't rare, you guys. These are common. Most catastrophic side effect from peptides. Let's look at it. This is where it gets real interesting. Okay, you ready? You guys, I need you to stop whatever you're doing. I need you to write this down. The most catastrophic side effect from peptides would be, you ready? Okay, this is so important. Transient headache, injection site irritation. International Journal of Peptides, 2020 reviewed 15 years of peptide related adverse event reports. The findings, you're going to love this. Headaches 2% incidence resolved within hours. Nausea 1% or less incidence. Mild and transient. Injection site inflammation 5% incident resolved in days. Transient water retention 4% incidence resolved upon discontinuation. Mild appetite changes 1% incidents. And I'm not talking about redatruide. It's supposed to do that. That's it. That's the entire side effect profile. But you have people on social media saying peptides are bad. That you shouldn't buy them from what? Anybody other research use only is dangerous. Not one serious adverse event. Not one hospitalization, not one death, and they're sitting there waiting for it. Listen, here's where it gets really devious. The FDA says they're banning peptides. All these docs out there saying they're banning peptides. They're trying to get rid of them. Take them. Don't only buy from compoundingies. What? The ones that the pharmaceutical companies control so they can load it up with all kinds of nonsense and charge you 20 times the price. So, you have to pay 15 to,500 to 2 grand for red tide. Are you out of your mind? And if you go, don't you charge that for a 60 mgram vial? They're trying to ban it for safety concerns. But didn't I just establish that peptides are remarkably safe? So what's actually happening? How about we just connect the dots? Look at the economic reality of this entire thing. The pharmaceutical drug basically costs approximately 2.6 billion to develop from research to FDA approval. This is tough center for study of drug development 2016. These are the numbers I'm getting where I'm getting my numbers. Okay, that's how much basically that's the average for a pharmaceutical drug. company has about 17 years of patent protection before generics can even be made. Pay attention to this because follow the money. My wife always says it. She is spot on. In that window, a successful drug needs to generate 5 to 10 billion in revenue just to break even on R&D and marketing costs. Okay? Follow a peptide. By contrast, naturally occurring biological molecule can't patent a natural compound. They're fighting that too, by the way. You can patent a specific manufacturing process or formulation, but g once it's out there, competitors can synthesize the snot out of it. So here's what happens. That means this peptides are cheap to develop. No billion-dollar R&D needed. None. Peptides can't command monopoly pricing. Peptides won't generate massive profits pharmaceutical companies need. Pharmaceutical companies cannot own the peptide market. So just think about that. I'm going to drink some more coffee. And believe me, I wasn't even going to do this podcast, but I was just so aggravated today. I went in the house. I was like, you know what? I'm so tired of the FDA. If peptides become widely known to be the superior option to drugs, more effective, safer, cheaper, why would anybody take a pharmaceutical? If they offer the elimination of managed decline, why would anybody take a pharmaceutical? Because a drug company can't compete with that. They can't lower their prices. Investors would go nuts. They'd revolt. It would be like a revolution. They can't improve their safety profile. It's built into the chemistry. They can't increase their efficacy. They're designed to mask, not to cure. So, they can only do one thing. They can only eliminate the competition. And they did it through regulatory capture. Here, I'll explain how regulatory capture works because this is where people get a little confused. The FDA is funded partially by pharmaceutical companies, right? This is called the prescription drug user fee act, PDUFA. Pharmaceutical companies literally pay for FDA employee salaries. Did you know that 2021 pharmaceutical companies paid 1.24 billion in user fees to the FDA? That's 75% of the FDA's drug center budget. Just so you know, that is an astronomical amount of money. So, I don't care how wealthy you are. I have a few billionaire friends. One of them is Howard Payne. I don't want to give the other ones away. And he is worth about three and a half to four billion. And he basically had to kill himself working to do that. He's a very good man. He is not trying to harm anybody. He deserves every penny. These are the people that are out to harm. So the people who are supposed to regulate the pharmaceutical industry are literally funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Make it make sense. When that's the case, what do you think happens when a peptide company, a small startup with no lobbying power, asks for approval versus when Fizer asks? The company that pays the bills gets the attention. The company that doesn't gets ignored or worse gets actively pursued and eliminated. The ban look at the FDA acting under pressure from pharmaceutical companies who provide most of their funding. I've just explained that began cracking down on peptides peptides compounding in 2023 severely. It's been really bad. Their stated reason safety concern all the shill doctors all you paid doctors out there explaining going it's for safety. We need to only get them from compoundingies. All you soccer moms that are going non-ressearch non-ressearch use the peptide companies, are you out of your mind? You're bought and paid for and you download it no matter how many times you're probably part of that Epstein list. But the data doesn't support this. Just so you know, there's no safety concern. Peptides have an extraordinary safety record. Zero deaths, minimal side effects. So what actually happened is this. Big pharma realized peptides were a threat to their profit model and they used their financial control of the FDA to eliminate the competition. That's not safety. It's money. It's money. The hypocrisy, the FDA approval doesn't mean safe. Here's where the intellectual dishonesty becomes incredibly obvious. The FDA says you can freely talk about how to use any FDA approved drug. Listen, I'll say it again. The FDA says that you can freely I could go online right now and talk about anything right now on this podcast and tell you how to use how every single aspect even off label use. I could teach you how to smoke methatate if that was something people could do. Why? Because it's an FDA approved drug. A doctor can tell you about Celre, its mechanism of action, its dosing schedule, its side effects. But if you try and explain the use of a peptide how to do it that's safe and effective, you get shut down, canceled, eliminated, or worse, you get fined. You might even get prosecuted. Why? If it's truly about safety, why can you openly discuss drugs that kill thousands, if not millions of people per year, but not a peptide that's killed zero? The the answer is obvious. It's not about safety. It's about money. FDA approval does not mean safe. It means profitable. I'll prove it. Look at Vio. FDA approved, marketed heavily, eventually just caused an estimated to be safe. This is what you know of, by the way. So, you may as well I call it my 10x rule. I didn't steal it from Grant. It's just what I've always been thinking. Eventually caused an estimated 27,000 deaths from cardiovascular events before being pulled from the market. Lance in 2004. The company Merc paid 4.85 billion with a B in settlements. They knew about the risks before the approval and they didn't disclose them. Look at Aandia, FDA approved diabetes drug. Oh, this is a good one. caused thousands and thousands of MIS, mioardial inffections, heart attacks, eventually restricted. The FDA knew about the risks, approved it anyway. How about Accutane? Oh, everybody's heard about this one. The act FDA approved acne drug. Beyond severe birth defects, still prescribed despite knowing the risks. Look at prennazone. Prennazone. Let remember what I did. The predinazone versus KPV, by the way. Remember that. Just remember those three letters, KPB. Okay, so look, FDA approved, prescribed chronically causes osteoporosis, imunosuppression, metabolic dysfunction, premature death, and still considered safe. FDA approval means we think the benefits outweigh the risks, and the company paid us enough to process the paperwork. You're welcome. It doesn't mean safe. It means it's profitable. Means it's profitable. Manage decline. Here's the biggest secret in medicine. No pharmaceutical drug has ever reversed a disease in the history of mankind. Not one. Not one. And I'll go one step further because you guys are going to go, you're pretty ignorant and arrogant to sit there and say egotistical to say you cure people. I've never cured a single person in my life. I've helped people and I've restored their biology and I've allowed their biology to do its job so they can cure themselves. No doctor anywhere any time in the history of mankind has ever cured anybody of anything ever, myself included. So listen about listen to the drugs. What drugs do is manage the progression of a disease. They slow the decline. They might extend life by years or months or whatever. They might make you feel slightly better, but they never reverse the underlying pathology ever. A statin does not reverse atherosclerosis. It slows its progression. Think about what I just said. It doesn't reverse it. And then they try and tell you it's not reversible. [ __ ] An anti-hypertensive doesn't restore your endothelial function. It doesn't restore nitric acid nitric oxide synthes. It just keeps your pressure number lower so you look better on a lab. A beta blocker doesn't repair your heart. It just makes it beat slower. Anti-diabetic drug doesn't restore your insulin sensitivity. just forces your pancreas to produce more insulin or it blocks glucose reabsorption altogether. This is what I've always said. It's called managed decline. You're slowly getting worse, but slow enough that you don't notice. And during that time, you're paying the pharmaceutical company thousands upon thousands of dollars per year. The profit model is not curing you. It's keeping you sick enough to need the medicine, but healthy enough to stay pain. Compare that to what peptides do. Let's just go through a few just for fun. BPC 157 for actual restoration of the biological system. Look at LL37. Antimicrobial peptide restores antimicrobial peptide function. You make it actually increases your immune capacity. Actual enhancement of your biology. Peptides are not managing decline. They are restoring capacity. Period. Full stop. It gets me so upset. The reason is so straightforward once you understand biology. Drugs work by blocking or forcing. That's it. They block a receptor. They block an enzyme. They inhibit a pathway or they force a response like forcing insulin secretion. But remember what I what do I always call drawings? I call them a wrecking ball. The problem is that every pathway in your body has multiple functions. Block one thing and you disrupted dozens of other processes that depend on it to survive. You want examples? Look at statins. Statins block what did I say? HMGCOA reductase which stops cholesterol synthesis. What cholesterol is needed sex hormone production? Less testosterone, less estrogen. I'll just go line by line through this. Look at cell membrane fluidity. So cholesterol regulates this. Look at neurological function. Cholesterol is 25% of myelin, vitamin D and steroid hormone synthesis, brain function, memory formation, Alzheimer's, dementia, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, all the result of having low cholesterol. Block it and you get muscle pain, cognitive impairment, sexual dysfunction, hormone dysfunction, all documented in literature that you can read anytime, anywhere. Look at proton pump inhibitors. Block stomach acid production. Now you've blocked B12 absorption, leads to neuropathy and cognitive decline. Magnesium absorption, which leads to cardiac arhythmias and muscle pain. How about calcium reabsorption leads to osteoporosis. Intrinsic factor production needed for B12 binding. So that goes back to the first thing I said. Gastric antimicrobial peptide production increases infection risk. Proper nutrient breakdown. You can't do any of that. Block one thing, destroy 100 others. How about NSAIDs? Let's just keep right on going, baby. You block prostaglandin synthesis. You know what prostto glandins do? They protect gastric mucosa. Blocking them causes bleeding. Bleeding. My dad took 16 to 18 Tylenol every day. He died at 67 years old. Yes. This pisses me off. Nades reg look at regulate renal blood flow. So blocking them, blocking them. This is prostaglandins, right? This is what they do. Blocking prostins causes kidney damage. Regulate immune function. Blocking them causes imunosuppression, maintains platelet function, prostaglandins. Blocking them increases bleeding risks, regulates inflammation. So some prostaglandins are actually anti-inflammatory. So blocking all of them paradoxically increases inflammation. That's why NSAIDs have killed over a 100,000 people per year that you know of. Drugs work through disruption. When you disrupt a symptom or system that has been built by God, you break things. Your biology knows what to do. You guys are screwing with it. Believing that something is going to help you when it comes out of pharmacy. Peptides work differently. Restoration and signaling, not disruption. When you I had this one idiot. This guy was in my group. This guy's such an idiot. I don't believe in peptides whatsoever. What a muppet. That means you don't believe in biology whatsoever. Sweating. That's how pissed off you are. When you introduce a peptide, you're saying to your body, "Listen, please listen to me. Here's a signal you're supposed to be producing. I need you to produce it better." Your body recognizes it. It binds to the appropriate receptors. It initiates the appropriate cascade, and then it's metabolized and cleared just like your body's natural peptides. You're not disrupting a damn thing. You're restoring a signal. Look at BPC 157 that this muppet lady decided to attack, saying there's no research that says it does anything. I can probably talk to at least a 100 powerliffters off the top of my head that have all gone, "Holy crap, it allowed me to keep competing." Uh-huh. Yep. Doesn't do anything, though. Got it. Your stomach produces BPC57. I said it signals for mucosal regeneration, anti-inflammation, angioenesis, does a lot of things. If you introduce more, you're just enhancing a process that's already supposed to have no disruption, no blocking of something else. You're just amplifying a natural signal that you're designed by God to have. The worst side effect, oh no, your stomach might heal too quickly. Your injury might heal too quickly. You might have an excessive appetite. I don't know what to tell you. Compare that to a PPI, which damages your entire microabsorption system for years. Your micronutrient absorption. How about thyosin beta 4? Your thymus gland produces thyus. It basically produces TB500, right? So, promotes cardiac regeneration, reduces inflammation. It's probably one of the cool things. If I could stay on it and take it every single day, I would. I just can't because the halflife is too long and you're not supposed to do that. It's not good for you. If you introduce more, you're enhancing a regenerative process that's supposed to happen in your biology. No chemical interference. You're not blocking anything. You're restoring a damn signal in your biology. Worst side effect, mild transient water retention, which just in all the years I've used it, I've never seen it myself personally, but I've seen other people talk about it and I've seen the results. But this resolves immediately the second you discontinue its use. I'm drinking some Coke Zero. If you you're drinking poison though, talking about pharmacy. How about you compare this? Look at it. reverses fibrosis and the myioardium damage from a myio myioardial inffection reverses it where they said too bad tissue's dead so now what you have a conduction problem or ki fibers can't do their job properly bundle of hiss can't do anything like the sa node doesn't work right are you kidding me no that's not true if you give your body the proper signals it knows what to do so compare it to cardiac medications this is what they cause electrolyte imbalances arrhythmias sudden cardiac death this is why peptides are safe because they work with your biology, not against it. Look at the benefit to risk ratio. Let's just look at the math. Look at NSAIDs. Look at NSAIDs for pain management. The benefit pain reduction, 30% reduction in pain scores, improved function, modest improvement in mobility. The duration, what are we talking? Four hours maybe. I told you my dad was taking you a ton of time. 6 hours maybe at the most. Here's the risk. GI bleeding 100,000 plus deaths per year. 100,000 events per year. MI and stroke. Just so you know, which is weird because they take you to take tell you to take an aspirin every day. You should take it before you fly though. Yeah. So what? You die in the sky. Kidney damage, which is a almost 100% guarantee with chronic use. Ulceration, one in 100, just so you know. One in 100. Oh, benefit to risk. Positive for acute use. I'll get it that for chronic use. Just so you know, chronic use is more than 3 days. Now let's look at BPC. Just look at BPC for similar indication. Just look at that. Pain reduction 60% clinical use. Inflammation reduction demonstrated through IL6, TNF alpha, IO and beta suppression journal of gastroenterenterology 2018 proved it. Tissue regenerate jewel restoration of damaged tissue not shutting down the pain that's coming from it and leaving it damaged. Duration a longerlasting due to regenerative mechanisms. So recovery versus symptom management. So managed decline or actually recovered. So let's do these risks. These are fun. The transient headache less than 2%. Mild nausea, never seen it but less than 1%. Injection site irritation less than 2%. I've never seen it. benefit to risk ratio, acute and chronic use, positive with actual tissue regeneration as a bonus. It's not even close. Not even close. The peptide approach is objectively superior from a risk benefit perspective. You could argue, but peptides aren't FDA approved. Okay, let's let's here's my response that FDA approval is irrelevant when peptides are safer, more effective than any FDA approved alternative. I could do this all day. I just have better things to do with my life than sit here and try and convince you of something that's going to freaking save you. Let me explain the actual business model because it's brilliant from a profit perspective and it's evil from a health perspective. The pharmaceutical company's goal is not to cure you. I'll say it again. The pharmaceutical industry's model is not to cure you. It's to get you dependent on a medication, keep you sick enough to need it, make you sick in new ways so you need more medication. Call me a liar, I don't care. This is called disease creation medication cascade. And you ready for my favorite one? decline. Want some examples? Let's have some fun with this. How about let's type two diabetes. Let's do that because this one's fun for me because it's everywhere. I've reversed kangaroo type 2 diabetes thousands of times. Full reversal, but it's not possible. Only need medication. Patient develops metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, right? It's another word for it. Prescribe metformin. It's always the first line of defense. Works on AMPK. Not even close to the same as MOS by the way. So metformin works by blocking glucose absorption and improving insulin sensitivity somewhat. It's comes married to a ton of side effects but doesn't address the underlying insulin resistance. So eventually here's what happens. 100% of the time metformin stops working because the problem insulin resistance is still there. Now they're prescribed a second drug GLP1 agonist. So GLP1 agonist increased insulin secretion. Still not fixing the insulin resistance. In fact, if you understand insulin resistance whatsoever and you've listened to anything I've said in the last year, you know that your cells become deaf to insulin. Your pancreas goes, I have to make more. Which makes it even worse. You're starving in a sea of plenty is what I always say. So now the patient has high insulin levels which causes increased fat storage, metabolic inflammation, and cardiovascular dysfunction. So now they're prescri wait it gets better. They're prescribed a third drug, an ACE inhibitor for cardiovascular protection. And if you guys are checking boxes off and what you have in your medicine cabinet, if you still call it that. Somebody made fun of me for that. I'm like, dude, I'm 52. Shut up. You've already you're on medication three. So the ACE inhibitor works, but it causes hypercalemia, which is high potassium. So they're prescribed. You ready? A diuretic like whatever it is, usually it's Lasix, which is a loop diuretic, ferosomide, which causes you to excrete 50% of the filtered load. That is unfathomable to me. It's so much. So, the diuretic now causes magnesium depletion. So, they're prescribed a magnesium supplement. The cycle continues. Each new problem created by the medication requires a new medication. The patient came in with one problem, insulin resistance, and 5 years later, they have, you ready? Insulin resistance still unfixed. Cardiovascular dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic dysfunction from all the medications themselves, cognitive impairment from the hypoglycemia and medication side, sexual dysfunction for sure, chronic neuropathy, and they're paying tens of thousands of dollars per year in medications, being told that it's the only way they can do this because it's the only thing keeping them alive. The business model is exactly this. This is business. It's not a cure and lose a customer. It's create ongoing dependency and expand the medication list. What would a peptide look like? What what would a peptide approach look like? Same patient. Let's just do the same patient. Peptide approach. So melanotan 2 restores melan same kangaroo. I got to say that melanotan 2 restores melanocort signaling. Suppresses systemic inflammation. Restores insulin sensitivity. Ratitude type not the pharmaceutical version of garbage. Promotes pancreatic beta cell regeneration and true insulin sensitivity improvement. Also solves a bunch of neurological issues. BPC57 repairs the gut barrier. Improves nutrient absorption. reduced metabolic endotoxmia. So now you have actual reversal of insulin resistance in four to 6 months, no cascade of new diseases, no medication dependency, you've lost the weight, you're functioning better, and you're operating like a regular human freaking being. But now the pharmaceutical company has lost a customer for life and they've lost potential future customers because you're actually healthy. Big pharma cannot allow this. Look at you want to know where it gets really dark is how they control all the literature. Who funds pharmaceutical research? This pisses me off. According to the National Institute of Health, 70% of clinical trial funding comes from pharmaceutical companies themselves. NIH analysis, by the way, proved this in 2019. That's already six years ago. Seven, if you really want to do some fancy math, okay? What happens when a pharmaceutical company funds a study? Just ask yourself that. Who's paying? Follow the money. They know the results they need. So, if a study shows their drug is safe and effective, it gets published. If it shows their drug is harmful, it gets buried. You want to see some examples? AOX. Merc funded studies showing bio was cardiovascular safe. Pendant studies showed it was dangerous AF. Not going to say it. I'm trying not to swear too much. Guess which one got published? The Merc funded ones. The negative studies were suppressed for years. Eventually, the truth came out, but only after 27,000 deaths. Huh? How How long are you guys going to fall for this? Look at Staten studies. Majority of Staten studies are pharmaceutical company funded. And surprise, they all show statins work great. independent meta analysis not funded by pharma show much more modest benefits. The Framingham study shows negative benefits. It shows harm and it's the longest running research ever seen. SSRI studies pharmaceutical companies funded studies showing SSRIs were safe and effective. FDA's own internal review which got leaked conveniently showed that 40% of the negative studies were never published. That's almost half you guys. So now you've got this, it's it creates what's called a publication bias. New England Journal of Medicine 2008 showed that this is called a publication bias and it showed what was published and what was suppressed and the difference in how it sways the public opinion on what they believe and what they don't, what they think works and what they think doesn't. This publication bias and selective outcome reporting is not rare. It's standard practice. What about peptide research? How about we do that? Peptide research is mostly conducted at universities and independent research institutes. Okay, the funding comes from government grants. NSF, NIH actually has a bunch small biotech companies, academic institutions. Some cases researchers own funding. They just do it themselves because they go, I want to prove this works. These sources don't have the same profit incentive to suppress negative results. If a peptide shows promise, great. If it shows problems, you know what happens? Researchers publish that, too. That means peptide research is much more likely to reflect reality than pharmaceutical research. How about the track record? Just look at the track record of this stuff. So, let's look at peptides versus pharmaceuticals as a track record before I go off on another tangent. Look at actual outcomes. Look at the pharmaceutical track record. Intended to reverse disease. Zero drugs have ever reversed a disease. Zero. For all you people going, "But it did to my grandma." No, it didn't. Intended to slow disease progression. That's modest success. 15% slowing on average. That's not very good, just so you know. Creates new diseases. Documented 25% of all users. Death rate over a million per year. Long-term health improvement rare, if at all. And the profit model requires ongoing medication dependency. Okay. So, let's swing the pendulum to the other side of the equation before people start getting all up in arms. Okay. Peptides intended to regenerate. Let's just same questions. Intended to regenerate tissue. Success documented. Journal of peptide science reviews 2018 all the way through 2024. Intended to restore biological function. Success documented. The same. So many studies it's almost unbelievable. Yet this lady goes, "There's no studies except some rat study in Croatia." Shut up. Creates new diseases. Zero documented cases. death rate zero long-term health improvement documented in published research everywhere profit model can't monopolize natural molecules so it's limited so it's not a business so when people go oh you're just ripping people off you know what if I made $10 million a month and that would be $120 million a year that's not even a fraction of what's being pulled by fizer alone from a pure outcomes perspective peptides have objectively far superior track record follow the money follow the power this is the FDA didn't ban peptides because they're unsafe. They're not fighting against peptides because they're unsafe. They're banning peptides and they're fighting to ban peptides and everything else and all these shills out in social media claiming, "I'm a doctor and I think you should only use compoundingies and only get stuff from it's going to be unsanitary and you don't know you have to check for endotoxins and all the other muppets that follow me and then steal my stuff and use my research that I bust my ass to get so I can give it to you guys because I actually care about you." Because I look at 9 billion people on the planet and I look at God left me here to give you the information so you can make a an educated decision. Like I said, I don't care if you buy from my company. I don't care if you join the black card. I care that you have something you can make an educated decision on and you actually go, "This guy gives a [ __ ] about me. He loves me. He's a real doctor. Above all, do no harm." That's why I'm here. FDA is trying to ban peptides. Profit protection, pure and simple. Pharmaceutical companies generate 600 plus billion annually in the US market alone. If peptides became mainstream, that revenue would evaporate. Look at regulatory capture. Pharmaceutical companies fund the FDA. The FDA protects pharmaceutical companies. It's a symbiotic relationship. They're married. They're in bed together. And both of them are gay. Intellectual property. Pharma can patent their drugs. They can't patent natural peptides, so they can't monopolize the market. Look at disease creation. The pharmaceutical model depends on creating and maintaining disease. Peptides that actually restore health are existential threats to the entire system. Look at market control. If people realized they could get safer, more effective treatment from peptides, they'd stop buying pharmaceutical drugs. The industry would collapse in itself, it would implode. So, they did what large industries do when faced with superior competition. They use regulatory power to to eliminate it. That is not for any other reason. Look at the hypocrisy. Why you could discuss drugs but not peptides. This is the intellectual inconsistency that proves this is about profit, not safety. Listen, you can go on any podcast. I could do this right now. I could go on any show. I could go on Ralden. I could go on Shawn Right. I could go on any major podcast ever, talk about all the drugs I want. I could talk about how to use statins, which kill people through liver toxicity and muscle damage. How to use NSAIDs, which kill 100,000 plus people per year minimum. How to use metformin, which causes B12 deficiency. All researchbased, by the way, so if somebody censors this, you know what? F you. It's fact. How to use SSRIs, which double suicide risk in young people. You can get this information freely. Your doctor can discuss it. pharmaceutical reps can market it to you directly and even give you free samples. Hey, I'll give you the first one for free. Come on, you want to buy an S? Like, that's how it is. But you cannot discuss how to use BPC157, which has zero deaths and reverses GI damage and heals muscle and tissue and proven transected tendon, a hamstring tendon, healed it in four weeks. Four weeks to full function, 100% function. How to use TB500, which has zero deaths and regenerates cardiac tissue. How to use melanot, which has zero tests, zero deaths and restores immune function. You can't discuss peptide protocols ever have to call a kangaroo. You can't suggest dosing. You can't recommend sources. If you do, you get shut down, banned, or worse. Why? Because if it was truly, listen, if it was truly about safety, this makes no sense. This is the same reason why I come at you guys, all you Insta bros and Insta experts and self-proclaimed PhDs with fuchsia [ __ ] hair and all the people out there that are going the mom sucker moms that are selling their stuff, trying to steal my videos going, "This guy's wrong." I'm not coming out and you're trying to sell anything. I don't have an affiliate code in my profile. I go, you want to join the People ask me every day, how do I become a patient of yours? How do I work with you? So, I give them an opportunity so I don't have to answer 5,000 emails every day so Mia doesn't break her fingers trying to answer all you guys. I do it cuz I care. Cuz I want to give you an option to come and if you need my help, I give you information because I care. I explain all this stuff because I care. This is tough love. You know what? I love you enough to tell you the truth. You love yourself and your profit enough to attack me, to attack people that are coming and going against what you're selling. You know what's crazy is we should all be in the same realm, all working together to solve the disease. Not talk about how we're solving the disease, but secretly marketing our stuff. I haven't gatekept a single thing since the day I started making posts like this. Right down to exactly how. So save your judgment of me because I haven't once gatekept and said, "I'll give you the rest if you give me some money." I've never once I'll give you the rest of the answer if you just give me some cash. Not once. Because you know what that means? Means they don't want to help you. They want your profit. So, everybody going online, stealing my stuff, using my videos, going, "I don't agree with this guy. He doesn't know what he's talking about. Apparently, he's some chiropractor that doesn't understand science." That was the most funny thing I've ever seen. I saw a personal trainer who probably couldn't even spell acetylcholine try and tell me that I don't understand science and that peptides should be blended. and you guys keep making videos about how copper should be blended with everything because you sell it or you have an affiliate coder because you've used it or you're just too ignorant stupid to understand biochemistry properly and you have never seen a patient in your life but you're the expert. So what I'll tell you is this. If you have a proven track record of people having full reversal of disease processes like I do, then come and talk to me until that day. Shut your mouth because I care more about mankind. You care more about yourself if you're making reaction videos about my stuff. If it was, listen, peptides are safer. We should all be fighting for that. The disparity should be reversed. You should be warned about drugs, but freely discussing peptides. The fact that it's backwards proves that the ban isn't about safety. It's about profit. If a pharmaceutical company profits from a molecule, the FDA allows you to discuss it freely, even if it kills thousands and millions of people. If a molecule is safe, effective, and threatens pharmaceutical profit, the FDA bans you from even mentioning it. This isn't medicine. This isn't science. This isn't safety. This is a protection racket. Let me be absolutely clear about what the science shows. Pharmaceutical drugs average benefit 15% symptom improvement. Average risk 25% of users experience serious adverse effects if not death. Death rate over a million per year. Disease reversal rate zero. Quality of life improvement negative. Side effects outweigh benefits 100% of the time. Look at peptides. Average benefit 80% improvement in measured quantifiable parameters. Average risk less than 1% experienced mild transient side effects. Death rate zero. Zero. Where you at now? Disease reversal documented in multiple studies. Quality of life improvement consistently positive. Nobody's ever said it is horrible for me. The data isn't even close. Peptides outperform pharmaceuticals on every meaningful metric. Listen, here's what they've been hiding. I didn't even want to do this. I don't even know if I'm going to post this podcast. You've been told that pharmaceutical drugs are the gold standard of medicine because they're FDA approved and evidence-based. That's what these people out here, all you doctors out there saying evidence-based, FDA approved human trials. You know what I got for you? Nothing but disrespect because you are a horrible human being profiting off of your own lies. Don't buy from me at all and I still give you the answer. You're on farmer's payroll. The FDA is captured by the pharmaceutical industry and the evidence is largely funded by pharmaceutical companies who suppress negative results. Meanwhile, peptides, which are safer, more effective, cheaper, and actually restore biological function and reverse all three biological failures of 100% of all diseases are being criminalized. It's not about science. It's not about safety. It's not not it's not about your health. It's about an industry that generates $600 billion annually in the United States alone by keeping you sick. An industry that profits from disease. An industry that's literally killing millions of people a year through adverse drug reactions alone. And when faced with a technology that actually works, that costs less, causes no deaths, restores health, they didn't compete. They didn't improve their products. They didn't lower prices. They use regulatory capture to criminalize the competition. They literally made it illegal to discuss the superior alternative. And the safer choice is illegal. The dangerous medicine is advertised on freaking television. You're not living in a free market. That's what I called it at the beginning. You're living in a cartel. Every time you take a pharmaceutical drug, without questioning why a peptide, which are objectively safer and more effective, why they're banned, why they're shut down, why they're being criminalized, why they're being attacked, you're participating in the protection of the most profitable cartel in history. The pharmaceutical industry did not become a $600 billion US, by the way, never mind globally, enterprise by curing diseases. They became this enterprise by creating dependency, manage decline, by making sure you are sick enough to need medicine, but not so sick that you die because a dead customer can't pay their bill, can they? Peptides are the antithesis of this model. That's why they can't be discussed. That's why they're banned. That's why they're hunting them, not because they're unsafe, because they actually work. And that is a threat that the industry cannot tolerate, which is exactly why they're coming down on them. It's beyond a war. It's a revolution. What side of it are you going to be on? I got to go. Hope you got something out of this. Themus.
