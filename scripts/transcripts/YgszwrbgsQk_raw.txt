You know, I come out here every day and I give you all this stuff for free so you guys can have a better life and I still get some coconut in my comments complaining and dropping hate and arguing. Except nothing that I do is instab backed. Everything I do, I've been a doctor for almost 30 freaking years. I Everything I do is science. I even quote the studies. Yes, I feel like having a Coke Zero. If you're listening on audio, that's what I'm drinking. It's going to make me hiccup, I'm sure. So, today I just This is going to be real quick. I'm going to see if I can shorten a lot of my podcasts. I don't know if you guys really like them longer or you like shorter podcasts, but I don't really care. It's my house. But I want to talk about redatruide and carbohydrates because there's so much misinformation out there and the Insta Bros. I look through Reddit and I look through Kora and there's hate threads on me which is hilarious to me because I give you the information for free to win and people still get mad. You guys are freaking idiots. But here's the deal. So I'll explain Reddit true tide and carbs and why low carb and Reddit truth tide is a terrible idea. It is it demolishes the results and if you go work for me oh I'll explain the science behind it and then you just go ahead and argue with biology and physiology and real results that I've seen with well over a million patients. So, we can go on this all day long. I'm still going to win and I'm still right. You know what's funny about modern medicine? It's funny because we spend billions of dollars chasing cures, but we're all just really chasing our tails. Look at obesity. Here's a pill. Even injection, even red or true tighter or semig, it doesn't matter. Here's something. Diabetes, another pill. Heart disease, you guessed it, another pill. We're not fixing bodies. We're franchising all the failure. It's a lifetime subscription to symptom suppression. I'm out here trying to change that. Like you guys know about this Reddit truth tide. It's this molecular middle finger to the obesity self-created. By the way, nobody has accidentally eaten anything ever. You are not accidentally fat. Don't get mad in my comments because you want to tell me that the food manufacturers made you fat and that you have a sugar addiction. No, they didn't make you fat. There's no such thing as a sugar addiction because it has nothing to do with the nucleus encumbent. So, we can get into this really hard if you want to get into the neurology. I'm going to bury you because there's no such thing. You want something to explain away why you have no willpower for a Snickers bar. Because if I said, "Look at this Coke Zero I'm holding in my hand. If I say this Coke Zero, I just I got to drink 10 of these a day." I don't. I drink maybe one every couple of days. But if I have to drink this and I get all twitchy and Jones out for this thing, that is purely psychological. This is not addictive unless there's something addictive in this Coke Zero. But it the caffeine's not going to make me twitchy. There's no sugar in this so it can't be that. So it leaves unknown chemistry if I had to go down that road. But it doesn't trigger the way the brain gets triggered to be an addict. So you cannot have a sugar addiction. It's not possible. And we could spend a day on this and I will just ruin people that say that's not true. My doctor told me. Then your doctor's a liar. And that's there's plenty of you guys out there that are doctors listening to this and you guys are liars. But listen, the molecular middle finger is red tide. It gives it to the obesity epidemic that is self-created and all and on top of that, not just obesity. Every chronic disease that it's dragging behind it like a bunch of tin cans on a getaway car or getting married, right? We have all that crap behind you. What a weird thing to do, by the way. But that's another talk. Reddit true tide isn't hype. It's physiology on gear. So, I will dissect it and the carbs and explain why you need them and how it's important and show you the studies and you'll see why your doctor or your Insta bro or your favorite influencers low carb gospel is actually sabotaging the very tools that you need to win using Redat True Tide. This doesn't feel good. This is truth that your body has been going, "Please just give me the freaking answer because everybody else is telling me stories." So look at the basics that nobody else bothers to explain. How Reddit True Tide really works. Forget the headlines and all the lawsuits and the class actions and the people saying it does this and semiglue tide worked better and turns up. It just stop. Red tide triple threat. It's the easiest way to look at it. It can sing. It can dance. It's fit. It's sexy. It's hot. It's got it all. The synthetic peptide that hits three gut hormone receptors at the same time. GLP1, GIP, and glucagon. It's like giving your endocrine system a SWAT team instead of a hall monitor with a little gay pass. So, I need to explain this because otherwise you're not going to understand why carbs are so important cuz they work. The only reason true tide works the way it does is because there are three agonists. GLP or GLP-1 and GIP combined are what gets in the way of glucagon's primary mechanism of action and forces it to do something completely different that's to your advantage. But it can only do that in the presence of carbohydrates. I'll explain. You'll see what I'm talking about. We're going to go down the biochemistry road real quick. GLP1 glucagon like peptide 1. It's the satiety signal that your gut sends after eating and reddit true tide binds to GLP1 receptors in the hypothalamus and the brain stem and it slams the brakes on appetite slows gastric emptying so you feel full longer but it's a lot deeper than that and I think that's the problem. They see all these cute little memes and cute little posts but it's so much deeper than what you guys are posting and talking about in the pancreas. It ramps up insulin secretion in a glucose dependent way. meaning it only kicks in, listen, when blood sugar is high, preventing hypoglycemia. 2023 phase 2 trials, New England Journal of Medicine by Jastrobof showed participants losing 24.2% body weight of that body weight over 70% was fat, not connective tissue or muscle, fat over 48 weeks. That's not magic. That's biochemistry suppressing hyperphasia at the neurological level. Okay, that's just the first part of this. Look at GIP. You have to understand this gastric inhibitory polyeptide. Okay, we used to think this was just a sugar sensor working the same way as AMPK does for energy, right? It's not what it does. Red tide flips the script. GIP receptors in atyposytes and the liver enhance insulin sensitivity and promote fat storage when calories are in abundance. But in obesity, listen, this is the problem. It's the opposite. Redatrides GIP agonism reduces visceral fat by improving lipid metabolism and it does this via cyclic AM signaling C. It increases lipoprotein lipase activity to break down the triglycerides all this stuff. 2021 in diabetes showed that the retatride increases energy expenditure by 10 to 15% and it does this through something called brown atapost tissue activation. So, when you add in GIP, you get targeted fat loss without the muscle wasting. But here's where the wild card comes in because we can go down the GIP GLP1 route and stay there and everybody can argue about it, but you guys are missing the point. Glucagon. This is the counterregulatory hormone that screams burn it when energy dips. So, reddatrides glucagon agonism isn't reckless. It's you guys that are reckless, but it's not reckless. It's very strategic. It binds to receptors in the liver and muscle, boosting gluconneogenesis, the conversion of amino acids and glycerol to glucose and lipolysis, freeing fatty acids for fuel. Now, you see where I'm going with this, right? This increases hippatic energy expenditure by well over 20%. Now, do you see why this is different? We talked about 10 to 15% with a GIP. Now, we're looking at well over 20% with glucagon. 2022 cell metabolism, they proved this number, by the way. So, we're talking four years ago they've known this. But here's the house twist of this entire thing. Glucagon prevents the metabolic slowdown that plagues caloric restriction. So, without it, your body is way smarter than you think. Okay? Your body adapts by tanking your basil metabolic rate. Red tide stands on the skinny pedal in that realm. It doesn't make a difference. It still keeps the accelerator down. So synergistically this triple action right creates this it's like a metabolic vortex appetite down insulin up when needed fats mobilized energy expenditure cranked through the roof human physiology bends to it because it's mimicking and amplifying what your gut hormones already do. 2023 Jastaster trial confirmed it. Average weight loss is a different just understand this is different. Average weight loss 17.5% at 24 weeks. Improvements in HBA1C dropping to non-diabetic levels. You ready for this number? In 80% of participants. The data doesn't lie. Insta bros do. Instab Bros do. Fake science does. People with soft little egos lie. Listen, I'm just giving you the bald-faced facts. But here's the problem. the sacred cow that you guys need to chop up and actually do something with carbs. So, your paleo bros, your keto gurus, your doc that says you need to go low carbs, preaching low carb is this holy grail. I see it all over Instagram. I see all of you guys talking about low carb for red tide. You guys are screwing this up so bad. And listen, for some it works short term, but with redatruide, low carb, that's like pouring a bunch of sand into your engine and cranking it over until everything seizes up. It actively works against the mechanism that the peptide is designed by the engineers to do. It's just like micro doing. And you guys got all but hurt about that. But the science is on my side. Biome or the biochemical engineers designed it the way I am explaining it. So you guys get and I had some lady get in my comments. It was hilarious. And she goes, "Not everybody's biology is the same." Got it. So your pyuvate and your TCA cycle and your etc and your lipolysis, they're different than what God built on the planet for every other damn human. Got it? That's the problem. You guys are arguing against something going, "Gravity doesn't work for you. Works for everybody else, but it doesn't work for you." That's a lie. That is you trying to justify that you are screwing up and you want to you don't want to admit being wrong because you're pulling that thread because then you realize you're the idiot that's in control of the puppet and you're the puppet. So maybe, just maybe, pull your head out of the sand and actually just listen to the guy that comes out here because he gives a [ __ ] about you. I'm the doc that actually cares. Take it however you want it. I'm out here not I don't need to be out here. I'm still out here with all the nonsense you guys throw at me. I'm still out here with all the stuff that I'm I take from you guys. I still come out here and try and help you. Listen, here's the deal. This is why low carbs works against it. Look, it reatrides glucagon agonism demands carbohydrate substrate. Glucagon doesn't just mobilize fat. Follow me. Excuse me. It ramps up something called gluconneogenesis in the liver, pulling from muscle proteins and glycerol. If carbs are scarce, okay, we got this. In a low carb state, your glycogen stores are depleted. They're gone. The liver under glucagon, whipping the hell out of it, starts catabolizing muscle to maintain blood glucose. Hello, sarcopenia. Okay. 2019 study in the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism. Rosentock did this one. It was awesome. Glucagon agonists specifically reatride showed carbohydrate 40 to 45% by the way dietary percentage co-administration preserved lean mass during weight loss reducing nitrogen loss by 40%. Without carbs you're fueling a fire by the furniture in your own damn house. Make it make sense. But the instab bros are right and that's fine if you guys want to listen to them. But you're just chewing yourself up. You're going to look like a melted candle. Look at physiologically. Redatrides GLP-1 and GIP effects thrive on glucose. GLP-1 sensitizes beta cells to glucose. It enhances something called firstphase insulin release. Low carb means low glucose spikes. So you underutilize that insulin boost. What? Why? GI amp amplifies insulin's anabolic effect on carbs, promoting glycogen replenishment over fat oxidation. Why? Why would you try and unwind that? 2020 human trial human trial in obesity compared low carb versus balanced carb diets with reatride. The low carb group lost less total weight 8% versus 22%. And more muscle by the way 35% of that what was lost was lean mass. Redat tide you guys needs carbs to balance the glucagon driven catabolism directing energy towards fat while sparing protein. This is in its design. You're taking your biology and you're trying to manhandle it and get it to do what some lines from an influencer are telling you to do instead of what God wrote in your system. Look at biochemically. Okay, think glycolysis. Just go right down to the basics. Glycolysis. Redatide increases mitochondrial ATP adenazin triphosphate demand via uncoupling proteins. I talked about this before in brown fat. Okay, so carbs, this is what I was saying about pyuvate. Carbs provide pyuvate which is the efficient gateway to the triricaroxilic acid TCA cycle right KB cycle low carb forces reliance on ketones are 30% minimal less efficient per ATP yield by the way proven 2018 nature reviews endocrinology they prove that just so you know before somebody's like how do you know that's how I know you're handicapping the engine real research you guys real research I'm out here to help you re 40 to 45% this is where you want to be real research 45 to 50% 55% % even carb percentage of your diet. Real research, man. 2023 phase 2 data implicitly supports this. Participants with moderate carbs, their version of moderate carbs is 45 to 55% of their calories showed far, not slight, far superior outcomes. Low carb blunts Reddit True Tide's edge. It turns off the fact that it's a scalpel. It's like a laser scalpel designed to work. Watch. This is this is why it's so important to me that you guys understand this. It's not I don't have some personal interest in Eli Liy or whoever else is going to try and manufacture this. I'm doing it because I want you guys to use it properly instead of blaming the peptide. You look in the mirror and you go maybe I'm the idiot with the vial and the syringe and I'm doing it wrong because I listen to some Joe bodybuilder or some guy who thinks he's an expert because he's got big muscles and gets on social media and can read chatt. I'm a guy that understands neurology and biochemistry and physiology and human biology better than anyone else I've ever met because I give a [ __ ] So, I'm giving you the answer so you have something to base it on. So, when your insta bro argues with you, you go, "Come here and just show them my video." You can try and chat GPT your way out of this all day long. It doesn't change biology. The reason it concerns me is because Redat True Tide, the fat loss is the that's an accessory. This thing shuts down freaking disease. All of them. Why do you think they want to charge 1,200, 1,500, $2,000 a vial? Because they know that most people won't be able to do it. Could you imagine? Listen, you can buy, like I tell everybody, you can join the black card and I'll give you all the deep dive on all this stuff and real information, not the generic stuff that I have to put out here because there's weird laws in place that I'll get censored and shut down and whatever else because if I give you anything, dosages, instructions, look at labs, anything like I can't do that here. So, you join the black card still at last year's price. You should probably jump in on that because I don't know how long I'm feeling motivated to do that because quite honestly, people are pissing me off. So, I'm just going to sit there and I'll stay there until I feel like raising it up to some outrageous price. So, I only have people that can afford that. Don't like it. I don't care. It's 10 grand. 9,997 bucks. And you will get it. I don't know. Maybe today's the last day. To be honest, it's not marketing. I don't have any marketing in this. I don't put any ads out, nothing. Maybe today's the last day. But I'll tell you right now, 25 grand is where it should be and it's where it is for everybody unless you listen to this and hear this. How about that? And then you need to tell me where you heard it. I want to know the minute, the time stamp, everything where you heard it because if I see it's not it, I'm just going to call you a liar and send you a bill for 25 grand and then you decide whether it's worth it or not. But I'm going to tell you, I have a guy in my group just so you know how badass this is. Listen, I'll even read it. His name is Michael Stims. You need to And I know I violated HIPPA. Oh no. Listen to this. I'm so proud or Michael I'm I got the last name wrong so I'm going to leave it at that. Listen to what this is real. This is him in my group. You guys need to hear why people join the black card. Good morning everyone. I feel motivated to share with the community today. I've really struggled with my health, especially the last 12 years. I've tried everything to feel better. I've seen dozens and dozens of doctors. I've been a vegetarian, a vegan, tried juice fast, water fast, dry fasting. Hell, I even went to the Amazon jungle for 30 days to do a diet and IA with a shaman in a tiny village with no running water, no electricity, and one meal a day, lentils and plantains. Needless to say, I've been desperate. Yesterday, he just started with me. This is the day after he just started in the black cart, by the way. Yesterday was my first day on the full protocol Dr. T gave me. I am Dr. T, by the way. And it was the first time in 12 years that I had a day where I felt great and [ __ ] great. My body didn't hurt. I had a ton of energy. I'm super focused and very motivated. I sit here this morning and I still can hardly believe it. I know it's only one day and I have a long road to go, but it's an awesome start, so I needed to share. Thank you, Dr. Trevor, so much for helping me. I appreciate you and all your hard work to help others. And if you want to see it there, I'll put it on here just so you guys can go. You made that up. Nope. That's in my group. I have dozens and a hundred of these at least. So, you decide whether you want to join the black card or not. I do it cuz I care. Yep. There's a price. No, I'm not doing it for free. In fact, it's going to be more expensive because I want to help people that really want the help. And so, there you go. You send it apply at unlock the card. Send an email there to get instructions on how to send the wire. Don't ask questions about your order or what it entails. The black card is this. Just so you know, pay attention. The black card is this. You get access to my live private Q&A call I do every Monday evening. You get the VIP community where I solve problems like this. It's actually me every day. I check every morning. I go through everything. If you send it at 3:00 in the afternoon, I'm not looking at it till tomorrow at least. 24 to 72 hours is usually my turnaround time. That's faster than any doctor on the planet. And you get my protocol library, but that doesn't really matter. You have direct access to me. You want to work with me. That's it. You want to buy from Elite Biogenics? You should. I'll tell you flat out because nobody does it like we do and everybody says that. But I don't run specials and sales and affiliate codes and bulk orders and discounts and all that stuff. I take care of my people because what's coming out of my labs, my warehouses is what I will give my family because I trust them or because I trust what I have and I love my family. Which means if you buy it from me, then that's what you're getting. So you decide. There's no gun to your head. There's no marketing. I'm not like, "But wait, there's more and give me your email and I'll market it till you die." Nope, there's not. But that's why I'm here. So you can do all the things you want, but that's why I come out here so you guys have the answers. So if you want to argue about low carbs, you can. You're still wrong. Look at look at here. Listen, look at chronic disease. Ask yourself this. Why does reddit tide have such a profound effect on chronic disease? Because obesity isn't the disease. It's the accelerant. It ignites systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and the energy crisis that fuels everything from athero atherosclerosis to neurodeeneration to myocardial inffection to you name it. PCOS retinatride doesn't just melt fat. It rewires the metabolic chassis of your body. Look at start with numbers. Start with numbers. Hey, you want to look at this? You want to really go down this road. 2022 study in nature medicine, Mueller showed red tide reduces IL6 and C I L by the way, interlucan just so you know, not A I S L E. Okay. And C reactive protein C 50% in obese models. 50 through reddited truth and its triple mediated anti-inflammatory signaling in macrofages. Look at diabetes. This is the one that's like freaking knockout. Redatride restores beta function. Beta cell function, increases insulin secretion while glucagon curbs the hippatic glucose output. Also needs carbs by the way. 2023 trial pro reported this homir improvement 60%. 60 60 reversing insulin resistance. Biochemically this happens through there's a bunch of different pathways that AKT if you really want to get into it. It enhances a glute for transllocation to the muscle cells for glucose uptake. So no more deaf cells and peripheral starvation of your system even neurologically it's so potent. Alzheimer's, type 3 diabetes, brain insulin resistance, red or true tide crosses the bloodb brain barrier, reduces systemic inflammation, improves hippocample insulin signaling. 2021 study in diabetes care showed 30% reduction in di dementia risk. Read a true tide, you guys, is neuroprotective gold. Why do you think they're trying to bury it, hide it, patent it, keep you from getting it? because they price you out. If you look at anything on that I sell and you're like, "But it's like $200. It's not 2,000." Red of Truth, that is beyond profound, but why you guys are messing with it and trying to shut it down and make it work poorly with low carbs. It's beyond me. It's an ecosystem repair. Chronic diseases aren't silos. They're cascades from metabolic mayhem. Read a truth tide douses every single problem at the source. All of them. Every single one of them. Ties directly to the three biological failures. Root of every disease. Systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, ATP shortage, obesity amplifies every single one, and redatride dismantles all of them. I mean, that's how easy this really is. Listen, this is it. It's the irrefutable chain. Okay, watch. Fix inflammation, restore insulin sensitivity, replenish energy, turn on the ATP machine. Red or true tie doesn't treat disease. It erases failures that are birthing all of them. heart disease, less less inflamed endothelium, better insulin in vessels, energized cardiomyas, cancer. Holy moly, marry this to SS3 and you are a cancer annihilating machine. Reduced IGF-1 from lower insulin, curb chronic inflammatory response, autoimmunity, balanced cytoines, dialing down TH7 cells. I could do this all day, you guys. We've been lied to by every single medical professional out there. And they look at me and go, "I'm the one that's telling all the stories." And yet, I'm the one with all the research going, "Here's the proof. I'll go toe-to-toe with any medical doctor because," and you know what? I've been a doc for a long time. Somebody called me a personal trainer the other day. I went, "I don't really know what to make of that, but I do know this. I know some personal trainers personally who would skunk most doctors in knowledge by far. My bud Jud Leanhard, smarter than probably 99% of the doctors I've ever met. He's so freakishly intelligent and he knows human biology, he knows human anatomy, he knows biomechanics, he knows physiology. Like, I look at that and I go, he doesn't have a doctorate after his name. You think because it says MD or DC or DPT or PhD or whatever it is after somebody's name that automatically grants them the ability to give you information because they know it? No, they don't. I've said it before, I'll say it again. Medical school is a trade school for pharmaceutical reps and most of the people on social media are shills for the pharmaceutical companies or banks for that matter, but that's another conversation. Listen to me. You guys have been lied to about low carbs when it comes to using this peptide. It's whatever you want to take out of this is up to you. It's aggravating. That's why I'm saying it. Low carb zealatry ignores the nuance of how ratide is designed. Retatrutide is part of the protocol that your body is craving. It's root level repair. You [clears throat] guys, those three biological failures are every single disease. I'm right. Where's my Nobel Prize? Because those three biological failures, you guys, are fixable. But you have to look at the science behind it and ditch all the dogma. Look at your metabolism and decide, "All right, I'm going to do what actually works instead of what my instab buddy did." I don't know. It's your move. Anyway, I got to go. Never miss.
