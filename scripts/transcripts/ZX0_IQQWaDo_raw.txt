It's wild. We had a little power failure. Screws up all your electronics when that happens. Huh? You ever notice that? Like everything here, this whole studio went just bonkers. But so I was thinking about something and I I don't know. Take it however you want. I'm going to be talking about Carterine and explaining it. So if you want to leave, then you can leave. But if not, then you probably want to hang out and learn some cool things about Carterine. But even my wife said, she's like, "They pay you a lot of money to basically be unruly." She's right. They do. They pay me a lot of money to be unruly when I speak and I either on a stage or I go on a podcast or anything. And they pay me a lot of money to be inconvenient and to say the thing that everyone is thinking, but too polite or too scared or too purchased to say. And I come out here every day. I just do it for free. Like this. This is free because I actually give a crap. I want you guys to have it all. So listen to me. There is a there's a 400 400 billion with a B dollar a year business. Its customers are prisoners and its product is sickness. And I've addressed this a lot, but you guys need to really listen to me because otherwise you're going to run into a whole lot of problems. Its desired outcome is lifelong dependency of you. And its most most convincing and successful marketing campaign has gotten you to believe that you are your own worst enemy. That your body is your enemy. That your lack of willpower is the problem. I can't even get my head around that. It's not a lack of willpower. It's a lack of the right molecular key. And I'm just going to give it to you. I You don't have to pay me a damn thing. The key is carterine and the multi-billion dollar chronic illness industry wants it buried. Listen, they tried to bury me just the other day. All the people hating on me, all the envious, jealous little toddlers that are going, "How come he's getting the publicity and I'm not? Because I come out here with nothing to gain. I'm not asking for anything. I'm just giving stuff away for free because I want you to have the answers. You decide what you do with it. That's up to you." But they tried to bury it. The card ring even, it's not just even me. It's the people that come up with the facts and the actual tests that show that there's nothing wrong with something. They they buried it with a single grotesqually mis misinterpreted rat study and they failed and I will show you exactly why because people go well cardine I heard it causes cancer. No, absolutely not. I I will cut through all the noise and the BS. Cardine GW501516 is a PP delta agonist. It's not a drug. It is a biological override for your biology specifically. Your cells have a choice. Burn sugar like a dirty, inefficient, nasty old grease fire. Or burn fat like a clean, high output jet turbine. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes. That is your body being stuck on the sugar burning setting producing inflammatory exhaust that rusts you from the inside out. Carterine walks into the nuclear control room of your cells and slams the master switch to fat. It doesn't ask. It doesn't ask at all. It forces it initiates mitochondrial biogenesis. Basically, it orders your body to build a bunch of new, cleaner, much more efficient power plants. And then it reprograms all of your muscle fibers from fast twitch sugar guzzling type 2 fibers to these ultraefficient fat adapted endurance monster type one fibers. You are being genetically rewritten for performance. Think about what I just said. The mechanism is this incredibly beautiful cascade of forced efficiency. And when people hear that, they go, "Well, it's forced. It can't be natural." It is natural. It's your biology. Carterine upregulates CD36. It's the fatty acid bouncer that shoves fat into the cell. It maxes out CPT1, which is the enzyme that is the sole turn style into the mitochondrial furnace. Think that's making all the ATP. It then cranks up enzymes like MCAD that break down fat into pure energy. Pure energy, which is the currency for every single thing you're doing in your life right now. Breathing, talking, listening, watching this, listening, all the things, driving, all the things you do. That's the currency. Your body becomes this vortex of lipid oxidation and it has no choice. That's cardine. That's cardine. Now to the organ drowning in the metabolic flood, your liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Nld isn't a disease. It is a it is a metabolic traffic jam. The liver is so clogged that it becomes an inflamed, scarred, dysfunctional wreck. You know what it is? It's the the airlift. It's the helicopter that takes all the wreckage out by activating PP delta. It forces the liver to incinerate its own fat stores. Do you know what this does? It improves direct insulin sensitivity, which is lifealtering. Crushes triglyceride levels. It is a genetic level liver transplant. That's the easiest way to give you information to help you understand what this is like. But why stop at the body? Why? How about you upgrade the motherboard, too? The brain is 60% fat. This thing between your ears, that gray matter that's letting you listen to this and pay attention to everything I'm saying, 60% fat. It craves the clean ketones produced by fat metabolism. Carterine crosses the bloodb brain barrier and activates PP AR delta in your hippocampus. And this triggers a massive overwhelming flood of BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor. BDNF is not a chemical. It's not a chemical. It's a request for for a hardware upgrade. It builds new it's like food, right? It just builds new brain cells and fortifies all the connections between them. And the result is this. Sharper cognition, much more resilient memory so you don't forget where you put your keys every damn day. And a brain that is armored against all the metabolic decay that is showing up weirdly everywhere because everybody is breathing, drinking, and eating all the garbage that they keep telling you is healthy for you, but you know damn well it's not. You don't just feel smarter. You are smarter. Yeah, that's carterine. How about your heart? This thing right now that's beating as we're talking. It's just going right now. All I hear is dirty dancing, right? Gung gong. If you don't know, you don't know. But it doesn't matter. In the song, Hungry Eyes, who sings it? I'll answer it for you. Eric Carmen. I could do this all day. This is the ultimate betrayal in metabolic disease. The human heart is a Think of how it has to It's got a beat all the time. It never turns off. You're sleeping, it's working. You're awake, it's working. You're running, it's working. You're sitting, it's working. Right now, it's working. And you, you guys, a lot of you guys just take it for granted, man. It is a mitochondrial powerhouse designed to run on fatty acids. In a sick body, it becomes energetically bankrupt, struggling on this sugary slop. Carterine forces the heart muscle to revert to its preferred fuel, creating a more powerful, more efficient pump. It orchestrates a lipid profile shift that is so profound, sky-high HDL, cratered LDL, and triglycerides, it renders entire classes of cardiology drugs obsolete. Huh. Weird. I wonder why they wouldn't want you to know about that. Huh, let me think about that. Oh yeah, three words. Follow the money. And for everybody about to get in my comments, please don't because I don't read any of them because I'm not going to engage any toddler that thinks they're right because they live on chat GPT, which is a store-bought AI that is designed to make you feel better and please you, not give you the right damn answer. So, if you're about to go, "Well, but the cancer." I hear all the hired skeptics all over the internet. All the bot skeptics and liars and people that have something to benefit from cardiological catastrophes. Fine. How about this? I will autopsy your disgusting little pathetic argument with the tools that you fear most. Context and intellect. Let's dance. How about this? The talismanic study everybody vomits forth involves rats. And here are the facts that are always conveniently left out and you'll never see them on some Reddit forum where all of the muppets get their information. The rats were given carterine for 2 years. 2 years. Oh, that's not the bad part. The dose was 40 mg per kilogram of body weight. Let me translate that from pharma BS into human. For a 200lb man like me, that is a daily dose of over 3600 mg. Let that let that land. Just let that stick in your mind for a second. The effective human dose for radical body recomposition, just so you know, 10 to 20 millig. They gave rats a dose 180 to 360 times the human equivalent. That is the equivalent of claiming water is lethal. You can drown in an ocean. That's why. Because you can drown swimming. Okay. The dumbest thing I've ever heard. Oh, but it gets better. It gets better or worse, depending on your capacity for outrage, I guess. These rats were also administered a known potent carcinogen alongside of the absurdly meggaosed carterine. Not only are they being given carterine at some ridiculous dosage, they're also being given things that make them have cancer. And even under this deliberately designed worst case scenario, the incidence of tumors, you ready for this part? This is the part that nobody will tell you. Not statistically significant across the test groups. It was a hit job. Period. Subsequent studies in primates and human cells, by the way, clinically relevant doses show zero. Zero. Zero cardiogenic activity or carcinogenic activity. Zero. None. The cancer scare is a fossil dug up and weaponized by an industry that is terrified of a molecule that could make their cash flow illness obsolete. It's not a single peer-reviewed study demonstrating harm at human appropriate dosages. Not one. Not a single one. Look for it. You'll never find it. What cardarine builds is a robust biology. It doesn't just make you leaner. It makes you harder to kill. It shifts your entire system from a state of inflammatory glycolytic fragility to one of oxidative anti-inflammatory resilience. You recover faster. You resist all the metabolic insult that is just being thrown at you. And you become biologically antifragile. Where do I sign up? Let me talk about the vicious cycle that this breaks just so you understand why this is such a big deal. Sedentary behavior isn't a choice. It's a symptom. Obesity causes systemic inflammation. Inflammation causes pain. Pain discourages movement. Less movement worsens obesity. It's a death spiral. Current treatments for this cycle are a catastrophe and none of them work. None of them work. They treat the symptom, not anything else. Carterine attacks the root cause. Dysfunctional energy metabolic problem. You have an energy metabolism problem. It doesn't make you eat less. It makes you burn more and burn better. And when you combine it with other compounds that target the root cause, that's when you achieve synergy. That looks like frigin magic. How about that? Kangaroo experiment. This is the holy trinity, I would think, in my books. Just me. Like I said, you do what you want. You come up with whatever you want. But I still know I'm right. Carterine. It's the master switch. It forces the oxidative fat burning phenotype that I just explained. Retatrutide triple agonist GLP1 gip glucagon that powerfully manages insulin appetite. But unlike solo with carterine protecting your muscles and metabolism, you you avoid any chance of sarcopenia. Although redatruide is pretty good at mitigating that. Anyway, this is a guarantee. It's like putting it in gold writing. M C. This is the mitochondrial derived peptide. I talk about this a lot. Repairs mitochondrial function. Improves insulin sensitivity. Works in perfect. I mean, it doesn't get any more perfect than this. Perfect harmony with card with Cardine's biogenesis. Create more is what that means. It's the finetuner to Cardarine's wrecking ball that comes in. Such a great descriptive word, huh? Wrecking ball. I love it. Just I use it all the time. That's why just comes in and just annihilates all the problems. The stack isn't additive, it's multiplicative. Carterine, watch here's how it works. Carterine ensures that the energy system is running perfectly at peak capacity. Red at true tide manages fuel intake and hormonal signaling and MC ensures that the mitochondrial nuclear reactor, the machinery is running at peak efficiency. Together, they don't treat obesity. They end it. They end it. They redefine what a human metabolism is actually capable of and how it's designed to run. You know, when you were nine. Listen, the current model of diabetes care is a lucrative patient for life business model. Carterine and this stack disrupt that entirely. They offer a pathway not just to management, but reversal and remission. That's why it's feared. That's why it was smeared. You guys, you you guys have been lied to so many times. I don't know how many times I need to tell you this. Your body is not broken. It's misregulated. The keys exist all the time. The science is rock solid. By the way, the only thing standing between you and a radically upgraded existence is a narrative designed to protect profits over human beings, over mankind. It's not your fault that you're sick. It's not. I think you being you're being fed lies and hypnosis of social conditioning keeps you in that position. But it is now your responsibility to get well. Stop accepting manage decline. Please, for the love of God, stop it. Stop believing the fear. The key is something you have right in front of you. And you know what's funny is I you know what the study because I some of you guys are well what's the study? Of course you do. Of course you do. I'm just thinking this out loud because until now you've only heard of the pharma funded whisper down the lane version designed to scare you because somebody's going to get into my comments or send me infinite emails about how oh but I read the study bro you're wrong. the one that gets paredited by every blog and pseudo PhD expert who couldn't analyze a study if it was printed on the side of their damn pill bottle. Okay, I'll go down the I'll go down the hole with this. Let's go. It's rabbit hole time. Dissect the corpse of this entire argument. The study in question is this one. It is the carcinogenicity and toxicity studies of GW501516, a PP agonist in rats and mice. It is by a guy. It's HP Hol the Pepper HP Holt. The paper was ultimately presented at the 2006 Society of Toxicology annual meeting. There you go. Now you know what it is. That's specific. Look it up. So get your highlighter out. Get your little notepad out. Get your whatever it is you're going to do. Your pencil, your research, your chat DPT. Here's the data, not the headlines. The species was this. Rats and mice, not primates, not humans. [ __ ] rodents. Oh, I was trying not to swear, but I just can't. It aggravates me so much. Their metabolic and oncological pathways are similar but not identical. This is a starting point right here for inquiry, not conclusion. Just right out of the gate. And how about the dosage, which is the fatal flaw of this entire beautiful system. Well, this makes me mad. This is where the entire argument collapses under the weight of its own absurdity. The study used doses of 0, 5, 20, 40, and 80 millig. Well, that doesn't sound like a lot. Per kilogram of body weight. So, let's perform a simple conversion. The fearmongers hope you never do. They hope you just don't understand mathematics. Basic third grade math. The standard human dose for body composition is what did I say? 10 to 20 milligrams total per day. Per day. So for an 80 kg, which would be about 175 176 lb male, the lowest rat dose in this study, lowest 5 milligs per kilogram, right? Outside of the zero, right? Cuz I said 5 20 40 and 80. The lowest dose in this study, 5 milligrams per kilograms, equates to 400 milligrams per day for a human being. The higher doses, 40 to 80 milligrams per per kilogram. This is fun. Equate to a human being taking 3200 to 6,400 milligrams per day. Per day. Do you have any idea how many bottles that would be? How sick you'd be? How screwed up you'd be? They were they were testing doses, you guys. They were testing doses 20 to 320 times the standard human clinical dose. This isn't science. It's not. It's a talk screen for deliberate overdose. It It proves It proves that if you take a massive amount of anything, bad things can happen. This is called the dose makes the poison principle. And they ignored it to create a headline. 2 years. That's the duration of this, by the way, just so you know. 2 years. This is a standard lifetime bioassay for rodents. The problem with that, applying this directly to human lifespan is pharmacologically naive. It's a useful tool. I'll give it this. It's a useful tool for risk assessment, but it's not a onetoone prophecy, you guys. That doesn't even make sense. Listen, the methodological poison pill, literally, this is a part they really hope you never read. The study was a standard 2-year carcinogenicity bioassay. In these types of studies, just so you know, it's common practice to use animals that are already genetically predisposed to develop tumors. But they do this for a reason. So, you can see that if a compound accelerates the process further, this gets even better. The models used spray dolly rats and CD1 mice. Here's why this is a big deal. They're notoriously prone for developing spontaneous tumors just like that, especially at an advanced age. They are chosen specifically because they get cancer easily. You're looking for a signal against a very noisy background. I just you can't make this stuff up, but nobody is ever going to go down the rabbit hole like this for you guys. Here's the results they actually hide. The tumor incidence, even at these astronomical doses, was not was not uniformly statistically significant across all groups and genders. The findings, this is the best part, the findings included tumors in various tissues, stomach, testes, tongue, pancreas, skin, liver, thyroid. Thyroid was a big one, but the key word is included. That's a scattergun effect, man. Just blam. Not targeted dose dependent carcinogenesis in a specific organ as a result of something, which would be far more damning, by the way. Be far more damning. The study authors themselves concluded it was a risk for carcinogenicity under the conditions of the study. The conditions being you ready for this? Insane overdoses in tumorprone rodents. You're welcome. You want to keep going? How about you contrast this with the subsequent re research? They never talk about primate studies. Buckle up. Study on obese insulin resistant monkeys published in nature medicine 20 did the study used a human equivalent dose of around 7 milligrams. You ready? Improved lipid profiles, increased HDL, no cancer, none. Human cell line studies, even better. Research on human cell cultures at clinically relevant concentrations shows no mutinogenic or carcinogenic activity at all. You want the mechanistic plausibility? This is the fun part. There's no established biological mechanism by which PP agonism at any sane dose can cause cancer. It doesn't even make sense. According to biology, the opposite is more plausible to be honest. By reducing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, the two known drivers of carcinogenesis, cardarine has a good chance of being protective. The cancer study is a classic. It's right out of their playbook. You take a molecule that threatens a billion-doll industry, tested at ludicrously high doses in cancerprone animals, get a messy equivocal result, and then pump the cancer headline through every compliant media channel. It's not science. It's not. This is a propaganda hit job wrapped up in a PDF. The truth is this. There is a more direct evidence that aspirin causes internal bleeding and acetaminophen causes liver failure than there is that carterine at a sensible human dose causes cancer. But you don't see them trying to ban Tylenol now, do you? Huh? Do you see that? No. They're trying to give it to pregnant mothers going, "It won't hurt anybody." Man, I dispelled that. I destroyed that with real facts, real research, proved it. And you know what happened? People got mad. It's what I told you yesterday. You pull at that thread and that thread of all the things that you've believed. Listen, you pull that thread of all the things you've been you caught it. It's like a disease. You haven't even been taught. You've been conditioned to you've been indoctrinated. You pull at that thread and if you accept that that you go, "Ooh, maybe that isn't right." Your entire world crumbles and that terrifies most people cuz then they go, "I've been believing and living and arguing and defending a lie for the last 8, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 years." You know the best thing you could ever do is go, "Son of a [ __ ] I was wrong. Now you can clean it up." Can't do that if you you know when the hole stops getting deeper when you put down the shovel. Listen, they're not protecting you. They're protecting their revenue stream. The study is their shield. You know what it's made out of, though? Bunch of Kleenex. Garbage. You're welcome. Now you know. Hope you got something out of this. I got to go. Never miss.
