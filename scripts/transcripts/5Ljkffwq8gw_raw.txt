Yeah, this one. This podcast is going to go off guaranteed. Probably get me in trouble. You know what's wild is the truth has been demonized, right? I'm going to just lay out a bunch of information about nicotine. And I read an awful lot and I do a lot of research and I pay attention to the people that are doing this better than me and coming out with information that is ahead of where I'm at. And I deploy that information to you guys. I just I want you to understand what's out there and what's really going on and how to solve your problems. And for all of you guys asking me, how do I work with you? How can you be my doc? How can you how can I see you? How can I get a consultation? I only have two options to work with me whatsoever. One is somewhat indirectly but directly, which means you have access to me on my Monday Q&A call. That's really me and I answer. I stay on the call for two two and a half hours sometimes answering everybody's questions and solving all the problems. And that's in the Black Card VIP. And this isn't marketing. I'm just telling you what it is cuz you guys keep asking me. So, I'm just giving you the information. Black card is is 10 grand, $9,997 for the year, which is insanely cheap. And if you go, that's too expensive. I'm not for you. And then I also answer all the questions in the VIP community of all the people that are in the black card. I have stopped selling the unbreakable mastermind and the unbreakable one-year. I don't do that anymore. I only do the black card and one-on-one. And the reason is because I know what my calling is and what my mission is. And it's to help as many of you as I can. To be honest, I need people here that want to be healthy and strong and juggernauts and people that have real health issues and autoimmune issues and functional issues and viral issues and whether it's cancer or cardiovascular. It doesn't matter what it is. Throw it at me. It's my it's my duty. It's my obligation to solve the problem. If I have the knowledge, it would be selfish and ignorant for me to keep it to myself. So, I don't So, I come out here every day and I give it to you. And if you just have a quick question to ask me, I don't do those. I will. You either join the black card or you work one-on-one with me. And working one-on-one with me is in a completely other conversation. But, and like I always say, you want to buy from Elite, great. You don't? Okay, great. It doesn't matter. I'm still out here every day. You know who doesn't do that? People who only care about money. They don't show up every day. They show up when the money is flowing and when the money stops, they stop showing up. I've been here before I had any revenue. I've been here when I the revenue was great. I've been here when the revenue got cut off. I still show up. It doesn't matter. So, the reason I'm saying that is to preemptively give you guys some answers. So, if you want to work, you want to do something with me. The Black Card VIP membership. The Black Card is the only thing that you can get outside of doing one-on-one with me. And again, it is wire transfer only. I don't do credit cards anymore. I don't do anything else. That is the only option you have. If you want it, you're going to send an email to support Spartan Army LLC and then Jen or Jessica or Amber, anyone on my team that gets that email. Jen is my CFO and the other two are my executive assistants. They're going to send you the wire information and you're going to send it. The end. That's it. And it's one year. And when I'm done running the promo, which is coming up soon. You know, I've been saying that for a couple of months, but it's going to keep going up. It's going to be 25 grand for the year and $2,000 a month to maintain. And my primary reason is because I don't I don't want people that come here without any commitment to the Some of you guys, you'll go out and you'll spend 100 grand on a car or a watch. You buy a $2 million house, but you won't spend 10, 15, 20, $30,000 on your health, your wife's health, your kids' health. I don't know. I'm the opposite. I'll live in a yurt in the middle of a field with a lake I have to fish out of in a bow and arrow to go hunting here in Texas if I have to make sure that my wife and kids are healthy and strong. And if that's not you, then we're not the same. And that's okay. I don't want to be like everybody else. I want to be me. I'm really good at being me. I suck at being anyone else. So, listen. Nicotine. And I somewhere on here is that medical disclaimer because last time I talked about nicotine, the sensors freaked out. And this will be on Rumble, which is probably where most of you guys are going to be watching it or going to have to watch it. But there is this lie. Listen, there is this lie. It is such a lie. It actually makes me angry because questioning it, it's so deeply rooted into you guys that questioning it feels like this moral failure. I'm talking about nicotine, right? In case you didn't figure it out, like you guys have been programmed or brainwashed and like Pavlovian dogged, just conditioned to salivate and freak out and go defensive and go it's addictive and all this stuff to you treat nicotine as a villain. It's addictive. It's a poison. It's death in a pouch or a little tube, a small controlled burn. That's the narrative, right? I'm not wrong. That's the narrative. Even some of you guys right know. Here we go. Here's another guy. Just to be very clear, Dr. Brian Artist. I have nothing but respect for that guy. He knows his stuff and he knows what's he knows what's what and he helps a ton of people, millions of people. So, a lot of the information that I get from paying attention to him. A lot of the research that I get, I read because he's pointed me in that direction. And listen, and like all the best narratives, it's designed, the narrative about nicotine is designed to make you obedient and dosile and most importantly a permanent customer for somebody else's product or service. The most listen, the most powerful broadspectctrum therapeutic nutrient known nutrient. Nicotine is a nutrient. It is not a drug. And somebody's going to say medical misinformation. No, it's not. There's a medical disclaimer here. And I am following YouTube's rules to the letter. So, if they challenge me on this, I'll challenge right effing back. It is hands down one of, if not the most powerful therapeutic nutrient known to medical science. And it's in plain sight. It's everywhere. And it's demonized. Listen, it's demonized by the very institutions that claim to protect your health. Make that make sense. What if the cure for staggering staggering number of chronic diseases isn't a patented thousand a month pharmaceutical, but something that you find in your garden variety, tomato or potato or eggplant or cauliflower or peppers. I It's celery. You guys probably eat this off of a tray when you go to some picnic and somebody doesn't know what to make, so they don't make it. They stop by Safeway or Kroger's on the way to the picnic and pick up a vegetable tray. But you just ate a bunch of nicotine. I'm not here. I'm not here to sell you a bunch of cigarettes. The cigarette is the Trojan horse. Before you're like, I smoke, I should be okay. No, it is the delivery mechanism that's the problem. And it's packed with 599 FDA approved chemicals. 15 of which pyroines are scientifically researchproven, peer-reviewed, documented to create the addictive learning behavior. That's what makes smoking so difficult to quit. Harvard did it. So, if you're smarter than Harvard, then okay. But I don't think so. Harvard published this in 2016 after reviewing millions and millions hundred hundreds of millions of pages of internal FDA documents. The nicotine, it's just it's the scapegoat, man. It's the fall guy. It's the psy that they threw under the bus. The nutrient that's taking the blame for the man-made chemicals added to hook you. I'm going to need some coffee for this. And let me talk physiology. Let me explain this. I'm repping good old Bedro right there. Bedro Cool. And if you don't give him a follow, you should listen to him. I say it every time. It's worth it. Let me talk about what nicotine actually does in the human body free from the toxic disastrous cocktail of a cigarette. Okay, so your brain is this network of receptors. The nicotenic acetylcholine receptors are fundamental to cognitive function, memory, neuroproction. So when nicotine, which is an agonist for all of these receptors, binds to them, it doesn't just provide some buzz, it upregulates them. It enhances the signaling and turns the lights on in your brain. Right? This is why study after study which is buried in the medical literature shows nicotine to be a potent neuotropic and a powerful ally against what? Neurodeenerative diseases. Man, I've been hitting that subject hard, huh? So 1994, listen, in April, the United States Congress, this is so important. The United States Congress invited the seven CEOs of all the biggest tobacco giants in America to come in and swear under oath one thing. Just one thing. We want you to all line up. State your name, where you are, what you do, what your position is, who you work for, and put your hand on the Bible, and under court threat of lying and perjury, the senator says to every single one of them, "Is nicotine addictive or not?" And all seven of them raise their hand, say their name, and say the following. Nicotine is not addictive. Interesting. Parkinson's disease. Let me explain something here why this pisses me off. Because I've lost people to Parkinson's disease. It's characterized by a devastating loss of dopamineergic neurons. Nicotine has been shown 100% to be neuroprotective to slow progression and in a lot of cases over 50% reverse the symptoms. It's not speculation. This is published. Search dietary nicotine Parkinson's for yourself. Just do it cuz I'm tired of dumping research on here. Go. Show me the research. Look it up. Get off your get your seat warmer out of the chair and get off a chat GPT or looking up, god forbid, whatever hub that you're on netwacking away and actually pay attention and take charge of your own life. Listen, the same is true for Alzheimer's, dementia, it's like caffeine, but the fundamental operating system of your mind. Look at immunology. The COVID pandemic, I haven't talked about this very much. I almost died because of all this stuff. The COVID pandemic presented a paradox that the medical establishment tried to hide and then tried to ignore, sweep under the rug smokers. The group we were told had compromised respiratory systems were they were statistically the least likely to get sick, the least likely to test positive, the least likely to be hospitalized, the least likely to die from COVID globally. And the numbers are undeniable. The common denominator, nicotine. The mechanism is elegant as hell. Look at the SARS COVID virus gains entry into cells by binding to the A2 receptor, right? So nicotine modulates the A2 receptor making it harder for the virus to latch on. It's this is why people don't get it. It doesn't unlock things. It gets in the way. It's a simple biological lock and key. So the nicotine changes the lock, but the story gets even more so it can't nothing can bind. This gets even more compelling. Long CO, right? This and lots of people do this. So if you are suffering from any long CO, you need to listen to what I'm about to say. It's the scourge of brain fog, fatigue, neurological chaos that has left millions, tens of millions debilitated. In January of 2023, a study on longco patients found that simple 7 mgram nicotine patches worn for 6 days. 6 days eradicated the symptoms, eradicated the symptoms. 50% are improved by day three, 100% gone by day six. Years of suffering, years. I know people personally that just they do not listen to what I'm saying. And I go, "This is what you need to do." No, I don't know, man. I hurt. It's addictive. I don't want to be addicted to some patch or some pouch or a mint or whatever it is you're going to do 18 pounds of eggplant. However you're going to get your nicotine, but you're doing it, and I'll prove it. I'll show you in this podcast. Exactly. You're doing it anyway. You're doing it to your kids. When people go, "Would you ever give nicotine to your kids, though?" I'll tell you a story about my son. Absolutely. I don't even think twice. And people like, "You're a terrible parent. You're getting him addicted." No, I'm not. My son's not walking around like jonesing for nicotine. Neither is my daughter. Neither is my wife. It's funny. Here's a funny story. My wife goes to this hair stylist. She's phenomenal. She's a great one. Takes really great care. My wife does great things to her hair. My wife is knockout gorgeous anyway, so it wouldn't matter. But my wife used to come. So this lady has been vaccinated up, down, and sideways. Has been exposed to She's in a tiny little hair salon. Probably half the size of this studio. And the studio is not that large. It's 14 ft by 18 ft. So sorry, nose is itchy. She used to come back every time. Felt like crap. Her eyes would be bloodshot. She'd feel sick. She'd She would get sick. She would just feel bad. Energy, lethargic, you name it. It's because I'm not going to say her name was shedding virus. If you don't believe in that, we're not going to get along. And then one day, Brandy says, "Hey, do you think nicotine would help me?" Cuz she's heard me talk about this a ton. And I said, "Yeah, maybe slap a patch on me before I go to get my hair done next time." She's never had a problem since. My son, my daughter, both sick, terrible cough, brutal fever, sick, relentless, both on nicotine, gone. I'll tell you the story later. But understand, think about the biochemical implications of this. This suggests that a fundamental reset of an immune system scrambled by a virus or in this case, go back to co the virus likely through the same pathway, the colonergic anti-inflammatory pathway where nicotine acts as the master regulator to calm systemic inflammation. Think about that. Look at cardiology. Myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle. No joke. Condition we've heard a ton about recently, by the way. Nicotine using a patch. Joan, research shown to reverse the symptoms of myocarditis within 72 hours. By day 14, the scarring of the heart healed. It's not This is not some weird alternative medicine where I'm a shaman dancing around with beads. And if that works, why not do that, too? Like, you guys are most people are so unwilling to do anything other than what's been FDA approved, but the FDA doesn't have your best interest in mind whatsoever. When I listen, you can pay the FDA $10 million. They will approve your drug on the premise that yes, by the way, before you go, no. Yes. Approve your drug on the premise that eventually you're going to prove that it works. You just give your word. Yeah. Trust me, bro. That is trust me, bro. For 10 million bucks. Put it on the shelves. No problem. You don't think that things are on the shelves and things are being injected and inserted and poked and prodded and rubbed on that shouldn't be there? Okay. This is not voodoo stuff, man. This is applied biochemistry. Nicotine's anti-inflammatory power is four times four times greater than most singular anti-inflammatory agents for arthritis. Small piece of nicotine patch directly to the inflamed joint eliminate pain within 24 to 48 hours. It's not anecdotal. This is you can see this. I get people I have a guy in my group right now. I don't want to put names on people. So that's the reason why I'm not doing it. Just I love him to death and had an issue with his shoulder. I I don't remember the exact so I don't want to misquote it but I think he said 10 years. 30 days later it was gone. Giant cyst in his shoulder. Put nicotine on. 30 days later gone. 10-year problem. 30 days later gone. What do you have to lose? Look at oncology, which is the big one, right? Everybody freaks out. This is a territory where fear reigns supreme. 2021 research demonstrated this is all about the glyobblastoma multiply, right? Which is one of the most aggressive brain cancers could be shrunk by more than half in 72 hours using nicotine alone. Oncologists in Spain and South America are now using this protocol with insane results. How? Because nicotine induces apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. It does it in specific cancer cell lines while protecting all the healthy cells. It's targeted therapy hiding in the nightshade plant everywhere. How about diabetes? I could do this all day. Publish that nicotine increases beta cells of the pancreas production of insulin in type 1 diabetes. Listen, I've had type 1 diabetics send me messages. I have people with type two diabetes that do not have type two diabetes anymore after listening to the protocol that I give them. They're in my group. I don't know what to tell you. You guys want to take your pills and your drugs and your lotions and your potions, that's fine. But there there's a way to solve the problem. They just don't want you to know it because it doesn't make a trillions of dollars. I've had a type 1 diabetic, multiple, by the way, message me who's been type 1 diabetics for years, told me that for the first time ever, their insulin needs are decreasing. A1C's are coming down just using nicotine patch for 2 to 4 weeks. How about this? How about this? So, we have a substance. Just listen to me. We have a substance. I know normally I talk about peptides and all kind of stuff. But you need to understand this stuff because my job as a doctor is to protect you and give you all the information for real. And then you decide what you do with it. You want to run around and go, "This guy's nuts. He's just a raving lunatic." That's fine. This guy's intelligent. He actually cares about us. That's fine, too. I don't care. I'm giving you the information so you can actually do something with it and protect yourself. We have a substance that protects the brain, regulates the immune system. It heals heart muscle, fights inflammation, works against most forms of cancer, and neutralizes nanocale toxins. I haven't even talked about that. There's a whole study where the doctor pulled nanoch out of the graphine oxide and the nanotech out of anesthesas and anesthetics, dental anesthetics and and viruses and then 10-minute soak of tobacco leaf and then put the drops on the dried anesthesia anesthetic and vaccines and watch the nanotech disintegrate because of the nicotine. So, we have all these solutions while the relentless multi-deade campaign of demonization exists. What do I say my wife says all the time? Follow the money. Look at Parkinson's drugs, you guys. Alzheimer's treatments, MS therapies, arthritis medications, heart disease regimens, cancer protocols, the annual flu, like vaccine industry. Come on. This is a trillion dollar ecosystem built on symptomatic management and lifelong dependency. This is a simple, unpatentable, widely available nutrient that can prevent or cure most of these conditions. Yeah, that's just not an alternative to these guys. It's an existential threat to the entire pharmaceutical industrial complex. It goes against big pharma, medical, and insurance. Listen, the FDA 1994 mandate forces the label. This is when it started. Nicotine is an addictive chemical onto tobacco products was not a public health victory. It was a very strategic lie. It was a Remember what I said? They all came in. Yep, absolutely. It's not addictive. Oh, we better hide that. Put some dirt on it. It was a deliberate act of misinformation to scare you away from the very thing that could set you free and keep you healthy. The endgame is incredibly clear. You remember? So, I got this is from Dr. Brian Artist. you. I learned a lot of this stuff. The five major English-speaking nations have already announced plans to ban the sale of all tobacco and nicotine products to anyone born after 2009 by 2030. Which means if you are born in 2009, you will never see a nicotine product in your life. They are systematically removing the competition before the next pandemic is declared. The FDA had to lie about nicotine because nicotine by 1994 was known to be a cure for all of these chronic illnesses. this nutrient called nicotine, not the drug. The FDA called it a drug. It is actually a nutrient. What is nicotine known to medical science to be preventative nutrient of? And nicotine is known to medical science to be a curative agent, a preventative agent for Alzheimer's and the dementia related to Alzheimer's and the rigidity and the tremors in Parkinson's and the demination in multiple sclerosis. Now you pair this up with a protocol that actually helps your kangaroo. Not just nicotine. Imagine this is just one of many facets of something that can solve a problem that doesn't involve a lifetime management of decline that actually is going to create future diseases. Right? Remember what I said about L-dopa. And what happens is 10 years later you have a whole new disease. Never mind the psychiatric problems that occur because of that. And they know it doesn't work because the problem isn't I've gone over this anyway. The problem isn't filling a hole. The problem is solving a reason why that hole was there in the first place in your physiology. How about this? You want to know the mechanics, not the headlines, not the fear, all not the you just want the biological because people are going to go show me the research. What's the physiology behind? You want to know how the this demonized molecule actually operates under the hood? How about that? Because that's what I'm really good at and I like this. So, I'll give you a full master class in applied human physiology. Let me get some coffee before we get started cuz today is Sunday and I have my webinar today and I'm not actually sure if I'm going to continue doing my Sunday webinar just so you know because I'm busy. I have a lot of stuff going on. So, we'll see. We'll see. Tonight might be my today might be my last of a few. I might just run them till the end of the year and then just call it quits on the free webinar and just get full throttle into my Q&A because it's filling and I want a lot of people to have and a lot of things I can't say on that free webinar before you think that I can give all these answers. I can't. I have to have them in my community. So, you want the answers? Look at the immune system. You think nicotine suppresses it? That's because they'll tell you that, oh, nicotine suppresses the immune system. No, it doesn't. That's wrong. It orchestrates it. The key is the cononergic anti-inflammatory pathway, your vagus nerve right down here. It's the superhighway for your parasympathetic nervous system. So, when it's activated, it releases acetylcholine. This is the neurotransmitter that binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the alpha 7 subunit to be very precise on macrophagages and other immune cells. Here's what happens next. This is biochemical genius. That binding shuts down the NFKB, which is the master switch for pro-inflammatory cytoines. TNF alpha, interlucan 1, interlucan 6, the signaling molecules that create these cytoine storms that cause all the issues. Remember my three biological failures. ATP shortage, insulin resist, low-grade systemic inflammatory problem. All of this stuff is married together. Now, is this starting to make sense? I told you you guys need to you follow me for a while and you'll start to string this all together and see exactly how this works. The real killers in sepsis and acute respiratory distress, severe COVID, pretty much every problem are these three biological failures. Nicotine is a potent agonist for these receptors. It flips the off switch on this inflammatory disastrous cascade. It doesn't play your immune response at all. It doesn't turn off your immune system. It prevents it from going nuclear and destroying the host, which is you. It's the difference between using a specifically targeted a sniper shot and a shotgun, right? It's that detailed. Like one saves a patient and the other creates a bunch of collateral damage. If you have to look at the medications, nicotine is the precision guidance system that solves the problem. Look at the brain neurology. Your brain is literally wired for this. Nicotenic acetylcholine receptors are everywhere in the hippocampics. The cortex, the basil forbrain, the centers of learning, memory, attention. When nicotine binds, it doesn't just stimulate, it upregulates. It increases the density and sensitivity of these receptors. It enhances the release of acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine. So think of it as upgrading your brain's firmware. The signal to noise ratio improves. Cognitive throughput increases. Neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to rewire itself, gets this this jolt. This is why it's neuroprotective in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, right? Not just on its own. And dementia and MS and all of this stuff. These diseases involve the catastrophic loss of neurons. Nicotine binding to those remaining receptors boosts their signaling power. It compensates for the loss and slows that degenerative tide, if not reverses it. It's a powerful lift and boost that solves most of the problem. Marry it to a bunch of other things like hypothetically cerebral, CAX, BPC 157, alpha GPC, GHKCU, which is neurologically protective all on its own. Listen, it's not about getting a buzz from nicotine. It's about turning the lights back on in a room that's dimming. And the room that's dimming is your neurological system. Look at the heart. This one terrifies cardiologists because it obliterates their simplistic nicotine constricts blood vessels. It's so bad mantra, which is BS. Oh yeah, it's a vasoc constrictor in really high acute doses. But in chronic lowd dose applications like a patch, it does the opp remember a patch. I got one on right. What side is it on? Right here. Look at this. You guys think I'm lying. I don't know if you can see it right there. I'm going to wear them for the rest of my life. So does my family. With a patch, it does the opposite. It induces nitric oxide synthes. The more more nitric oxide means better vasoddilation. I went over this with methylene blue, by the way, too. But more nitric oxide means more vasoddilation, improved endothelial function, and increased blood flow. All of those are good things, by the way. It is an incredibly potent anti-riythmic. It stabilizes cardiac cells by modulating potassium and calcium channels. Remember, the heart has these voltage gated calcium channels. It prevents the erratic firing that leads to aphib tacic cardia. How about for myocarditis? I talked about this already. It slams the brakes on the inflammatory attack on the heart muscle itself. The heart is a muscle. Inflammation cripples it. Just so you know, nicotine stops the inflammation. It allows the muscle to repair. It gives it the break that it needs so it can actually turn on the repair system and start doing it. Imagine hypothetically, and I'm giving you these so you get the answer without me getting in trouble. Imagine hypothetically for your kangaroo, you marry this with BPC-157 and TB500, which is the only thing that walks into the room and says, "You know what? Let me handle this fibrosis and damage to the myioardium right now." And it does it. Imagine if you put all that together hypothetically. The scarring heals. It's not magic. It's called cellular cardiology. Look at the liver. This is the body's detox center, right? Nicotine induces cytochrome P450 enzymes. This is your liver's own turbocharged processing line. I need more coffee. going to keep my eye could stay on here all day about this one because I love this stuff. So, what it does is it ramps up metabolic clearance of toxins, antibiotics, all the waste products and garbage and junk that's not supposed to be there. It's like putting your liver on a as I'm drinking coffee. It's easiest example. It's like a caffeine drip. It upregulates NRF2 which is the master regulator of antioxidant response. And what's the primary antioxidant? The mo most powerful one in the body is glutathione. Right? So, this leads to this big surge in glutathione production, which is this insane powerful innate antioxidant that your body can't live without. And it's the one that, by the way, Tylenol demolishes for all you people taking handfuls of those every day. It's why my dad died. Nicotine doesn't poison the liver. It arms it with the biochemical tools to defend itself properly and do all the work it's required and designed to do. Look at the lungs. This is the irony of this entire thing. The organ we're told is destroyed by nicotine containing products is actually protected by nicotine itself. I'll even explain how it's done through the same chonergic anti-inflammatory pathway lung conditions. It's asthma, bronchitis, they're all driven by that same NFCappa B cytoine cascade. Right? Remember what I said? Cytoine storms demolish your system. Your body can't stand inflammation when it's longterm. It's there for a precise reason and then it needs to go away where it doesn't. Nicotine calms the inflammation. It stimulates the production of something called surfactant on the alvoli, which is that it's that covering. It's that slippery mucus that allows gas exchange when the surfactant is that's why NAC is really good too. An acetylcysteine but and that's another podcast I should get into. We they tried to ban that by the way during CO they tried to ban NAC. I wonder why. We could really go down the rabbit hole. Couldn't we have some fun on this one? When you stimulate the production of surfactant in the alvola, you improve lung compliance and gas exchange. The problem was never the nicotine. It was the tar, right? The combustion products. these and the 599 other chemicals they added to the tobacco isolate the nicotine and the lung gets a protective anti-inflammatory agent that does its job and helps you doesn't hurt you remember 15 pyroines there's your addiction so people go how do I start I'm actually afraid to even talk about this one but hey I've gone this far if you buy nicotine patches because if you take a ton in a large dose sure you might get a ton of diarrhea might feel a little nauseated so don't do that that's why patches work the best because it's a slow infusion cut them into 1 milligram sizes. Slap it on a joint that's hurting. If there's your arthritis, put the nicotine patch right on that thing. It's your hip. It's your elbow. If it's your knuckle right here, if it's your knee. I get messages from people all the time telling me that within a day or two at the most of putting a nicotine patch on any joint where they have had arthritis for years, all the pain is gone. This isn't me, by the way, that did all this research. This is Brian Artist. This is Dr. Artist. Listen, here's the sign of an exceptional educator, which is, by the way, what all of us doctors are supposed to be. Doctor means teacher. And a lot of you guys are you're arrogant and you're ignorant and you're too busy going, "They're stealing my business. I don't like what they're saying because it contradicts the lies I've been telling my patients or my customers." Maybe stop lying to them and maybe just stop lying to them. Tell them the truth. Help these people. Listen, the sign of an exceptional doctor is one that's willing to continue learning and applying the benefit to mankind. You're welcome. I'm just repeating what the scientists have known for decades and published that medical medical professions weren't taught in med school. that I wasn't taught any of this stuff. Most I don't know any doctors that were taught this stuff. You're not being told in mainstream media that nicotine is also published to be a curative agent for ulcerative colitis, which is an immune an autoimmune digestive disorder where they actually cut out parts of your colon when they say it dies. It's published that it can cure that. How about hypothyroidism in women and men? Yep. Shown to cure the symptoms of that. Hashimoto's shown viral destruction. This one's fun. Like this is such a powerful nutrient. Why do you think it's hidden? And it's hidden in plain sight because it's demonized. So look at viruses because I was I said I was going to talk about my son. Viruses are obligate parasites. They can't replicate on their own, right? So they need to hijack your cellular machinery. Viruses like influenza, SARS, COVID, rabies, they have a known tropism. They have a preference. They target cells that express, you love this, specific receptors. And a large number of them have affinity for, wait for it, nicotenic acetyloline receptors. It's like a docking port. rabies published and known by science to be cured with nicotine because it's target it targets nicotine receptors. HIV cured with nicotine, schizophrenia cured with nicotine. And all these scientists have proved this. Every single influenza virus family member, there are 29 different influenza viruses. By the way, all of them target nicotinic receptors. You guys are questioning why you shouldn't wear why you should wear a nicotine patch all the time. I don't know about you, but I don't like getting sick at all. What if you never got sick again? And most of you guys just went, that's not possible. You're not supposed to get sick. You're taught that you're supposed to get sick all the time. You are conditioned to think that every year there is a flu pandemic, right? Oh, it's flu season. How is there a flu season? Just unpack that. Don't take my word for it. I told you this podcast is going to be different this one today. It just unpack it. It bugs me. How is there a flu season? This this yearly poisoning scenario that they come up with. Get out of here. You know what I hear all the time? One of my one of my friends mothers used to say this. Oh, every time I get the flu shot, I get sick. Why do you keep getting the flu shot? I don't want to ever have to feel I need to protect myself from getting the flu and any sniffle I get becomes this knee-jerk reflex to get an injection when I can prevent the whole thing from happening altogether. What if he never got a cold again? Really, what? Nothing. Zero. Not a sniffle. Nothing. What if? That's wild. I had this conversation with a lot of people. Even one of my friends. He's a good friend of mine. He's an attorney. Incredibly intelligent man. But most people's viewpoint of nicotine is that it's addictive. Most I've never met an MD whose viewpoint of nicotine isn't anything other than it's addictive. But watch this. If it if nicotine is as addictive as it says it is, and you've been taught to believe it is, then the very first thing should be this. Have you read the study from Harvard 2016 where they said nicotine is not responsible for the addictive quality of tobacco products? And have you read what they said is? And do you think that more than any of the people doing this research? because you are a single person standing here in front of me arguing ignorantly. Go look at the research. Don't take my word for it. In fact, don't ever take my word for it. I come out here to give it to you. It's your job to go and make sure you understand and believe it. If you think nicotine is so addictive, you ever eat tomatoes, eggplants, celery, cauliflower? I'm not a big fan of eggplant or cauliflower. And the fact that eggplant looks like friaking grimace from old school McDonald's is a completely other conversation, which is weird. What the hell is grimace? Just to have to ask that. One of you guys, jocks, send me a picture of Grimace, which is hilarious. What is he? He is an eggplant with legs. If somebody can identify that creature, I'd love to know. Somebody send me a message. I want to know. Remember what I said at the beginning where I said you guys went to a picnic and you grabbed vegetables, you grabbed a tray at Safeway or Kroger's or whatever. Did you ever get Did you ever twitch and freak out after doing that and be like, "Oh my god, I need that." You wake up in the middle of the night sweaty heart palpitations, freaking out because you had to run to the kitchen, grab a bunch of tomatoes, and start smashing them. No, you didn't. It's what you did is you ate the tomato and you never thought about it again. You ate the the you guys in your cauliflower crust pizza. Think of all the nicotine you're getting there. Do you ever freak out and go, "Oh my god, I have to go. We need to go right now. Mod Pizza. I need the cauliflower crust." No, you don't. How many kids have you seen addicted to potato chips? And I'm not talking because they're potato chips. You know the potatoes have nicotine. That's why I'm saying it. If nicotine is dangerous, this is why when people go, "You give that to your kids. You give French fries, McDonald's, potato chips, ketchup to your kids. The sugar is what's addictive by the way and that's again another podcast. Why do you keep feeding it to your kids if nicotine is so addictive? Where you can't it's not you guys. Your paradigms are you have cognitive dissonance. You're just having these arguments in your head. You can do one thing but not the other. But they're the same thing. So how does that make sense? I want you guys to start asking yourselves better questions. Please. If your kid was sick and you knew that nicotine was something that might cure it. If you are like I'm just not putting a nicotine patch on my son or my daughter. Okay. Then just stack a bunch of potatoes or celery or eggplant. Make them eat the eggplant. My parents did. I didn't like it, but they made musaka. I couldn't stand that stuff, but they made me eat it. They were stuffing me full of nicotine. My mom and dad were terrible. No, they weren't. My mom and dad are fantastic. Just start hammering those vegetables into your kids' barrel instead of snack packs and unidentifiable things that come out of rappers. If you're worried about giving them a nicotine patch or you're worried about taking one yourself, do some math and figure out how many of whatever vegetable you need to eat to get two, three, four milligrams of nicotine into yourself every day. I bet you'd be surprised at how much you're already eating. So, go eat a bunch of it if you don't if you don't want to do it. I'm not telling you to go get nicotine patches, rugby patches, by the way, from Ford Medical on Amazon. I never said to go do that. Listen, my son was sick. I said my son and my daughter were sick. It just wouldn't get better. It was getting to the point where stressing me out. I actually talked about it on our podcast. It was bothering me. It just kept getting worse. It was bad enough for me to get concerned and finally go, "Man, I may have to go somewhere." And then I went, "Don't you dare. Don't you dare, Dr. T. Don't you dare. The 3.5 mil." He's 16. slapped a 3.5 milligram nicotine patch, rugby patch on him. And for all of you guys who go, "Oh, what a horrible parent. I guess we'll see." I'm going to say no. He was better by the next morning, at least 50%. My daughter would come and ask, "Hey, can you put a nicotine patch on me?" Because she was stubborn. My daughter is I love my daughter, but she's obstinate as hell. She finally went, "Okay, she started getting better." You guys have a choice. So, you can, by the way, most antibiotics cause respiratory illnesses to get significantly worse. Leave you with that, but I'm not done yet. My son did the next morning when he got up after I stuck that nicotine the half. I just cut it in half. Take a seven milligram. Just cut it in half. He said, "I feel better already. Can you do that again?" So here what happens? Listen. What happens when you saturate those receptors with their native liand nicotine, you create this biochemical shield. So you block the vir what did I call it? A docking port. You block that viral docking site. So the virus floats around looking for a port to plug into, but every slot is already occupied by a nicotine molecule. No entry, no replication, no infection. It's not that nicotine kills the virus in the bloodstream like an antibiotic out. And by the way, I get it, antibiotics are for bacteria, not virus, but I'm just giving you an example. It out competes it at the point of cellular entry. It's a strategic blockade. And how about this? for viruses that have already infected cells. Nicotine's role in upregulating the innate immune response. Interferon production, the natural killer cell activity, it's incredibly potent anti-inflammatory action prevents the immune system from spiraling into a suicidal frenzy trying to kill the viruses. This is what it does. It basic in plain English, it maintains defensive cohesion. It doesn't let the immune system go nuclear and put you in a hurt locker because it doesn't know how to turn off. So listen, let me just explain it one more time before because I got to go. This is the entire This is the rub. They took a molecule that functions as a neuroprotectant, an immunom modulator, a cardioabilizer, a hippatic inducer, an anti-inflammatory. What else does it do? Antiviral blocking agent. And they convinced you that it was a poison. I have nothing to gain. Nobody's writing me a check for this, by the way. I'm just giving you the information. The lie wasn't a mistake, you guys. It was a very strategic necessity for an entire industry, what do I say? built on sickness. It's for managed decline. It's to protect it. They didn't just hide the data. They built a cultural prison to keep you from it. So now it's not they don't they can put it out right now. They could come out and tell you the truth and you guys will fight to defend that. No, that's not true. They've gotten the the script flipped and they get you guys battling for it to defend their narrative. Your body, the biology that you have, your system has been waiting for you to figure this out. The receptors are there for a reason, right? They're not there for no reason. Your immune system is turned on by nicotine. Not turned off, not muted, not slowed down, not weakened. I could stay out here all day like this stuff is fun for me. Look at take take a thousand foot view at everything that I just said and actually understand why I'm telling you this. I got nothing to gain, but you do. I'm telling you right now, you know who should be worried? Everybody that's trying to keep you away from nicotine. Just my opinion. Anyway, I got to go. Ever miss.
